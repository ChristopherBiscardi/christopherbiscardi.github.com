This week we've been going over multi-package repo tools. Today I want to share a workflow that is enabled by those tools, even across different tooling.

Some of the work I do on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) requires me to work on the core `gatsby` package or a small number of other packages. I don't need to bootstrap the entire repo, but I do need specific packages.

## The Workflow

When I work on [Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-11-11-introducing-gatsby-themes/), I usually use a repo called [gatsby-theme-examples](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-examples). This repo is set up as a multi-package repo using Yarn Workspaces. `gatsby-theme-examples` includes a couple of themes and a couple of usages of said themes, so when I work on new functionality like [child theming](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/10787), there's a [PR on gatsby-theme-examples](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-examples/pull/13) that uses that functionality.

I handle both of these PRs to separate repos in the same multi-package repo that spans two git repos. The setup looks like this

```
git clone git@github.com:ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-examples.git
cd gatsby-theme-examples
mkdir vendored-gatsby
cd vendored-gatsby
git clone git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby.git
```

I clone the gatsby repo into a sub-directory of the examples repo, then point the Yarn Workspaces config in the theme examples `package.json` to include the packages I need. By default the workspaces config looks like

```js
{
  "name": "gatsby-theme-examples",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "christopherbiscardi <chris@christopherbiscardi.com> (@chrisbiscardi)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "themes/*",
    "ui-surfaces/*"
  ]
}
```

When working with a forked Gatsby repo I add the packages I need, so if all I need is `gatsby`, it looks like

```js
{
  "name": "gatsby-theme-examples",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "christopherbiscardi <chris@christopherbiscardi.com> (@chrisbiscardi)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "themes/*",
    "ui-surfaces/*",
    "vendored-gatsby/packages/gatsby"
  ]
}
```

Show gatsby-theme-examples workflow pulling in gatsby itself.

Argue for starting all NPM based projects as yarn workspaces for easier extension later.
