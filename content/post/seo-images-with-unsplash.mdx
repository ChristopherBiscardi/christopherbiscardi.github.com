I added an [SEO
component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-seo-component/) to my
blog recently and on top of that I decided to set up infrastructure to
pull in images for Twitter, etc. The SEO component already handled
titles and descriptions for cards on Twitter, but I wanted something a
bit more... interesting. I like large images and I eventually want to
start drawing images for my blog posts. So I dove into
[gatsby-transformer-sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-transformer-sharp).

The sharp transformer makes it absolutely trivial to handle an image
described in frontmatter and post it as a Twitter meta card.
