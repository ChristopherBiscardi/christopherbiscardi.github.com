I've been idly thinking about how to do comments on my blog since a few people I follow on Twitter have started asking again. Now, to be fair, I don't want a "comments section" on my blog; That sounds horrible. What I do want, is a link to the Twitter conversations around the content I'm writing so that the conversations happening around the internet are accessible when you're reading the blog.

So I had a flight last Friday and just before my flight I found out about the [Webmention standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) because [Max BÃ¶ck](https://twitter.com/mxbck) wrote a [blog post](https://mxb.at/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/) on using them. So I dove into the blog post, quick-opened a set of tabs I might need and got to work on the plane.

# A Gatsby Plugin

One aspect of setting everything up for webmentions that I wanted to abstract was the number of deploys and html snippets you need to do and remember to set everything up. My platform of choice that would use any Webmention-related content is [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) so I took the time I had on the plane to write [gatsby-plugin-webmention](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-plugin-webmention).

The plugin breaks down the webmention setup experience roughly into:

1. Set a username from twitter or github
1. Use domain name to log in to https://webmention.io/ using the aforementioned platform
1. Set webmention username

## Inserting the tags

Gatsby offers an API called [wrapRootElement](/post/controlling-the-gatsby-application-root) that lets us insert information once for the entire site. We can combine this with [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) to [insert the meta tags](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-plugin-webmention/blob/15eae29b2ea5ebc2704c38610e8ae5ebff38a6f2/wrap-root-element.js) that identify our accounts without making them visible to the user. There's a few of them and they look like this:

```html
<link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/username/webmention" />
<link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/username/xmlrpc" />
```

There's also some that need to be inserted based on the configuration. That's why the first thing I did was write the [README.md](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-plugin-webmention). I planned out what the workflow would be for a new user and then built that out afterwards.

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-webmention`,
      options: {
        username: undefined, // webmention.io username
        identity: {
          github: "username",
          twitter: "username" // no @
        },
        mentions: true,
        pingbacks: false,
        forwardPingbacksAsWebmentions: "https://example.com/endpoint",
        domain: "example.com",
        token: process.env.WEBMENTIONS_TOKEN
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

## A Source

The other large piece of webmentions is... accessing them via some API. That means we need a source.

```js
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
const queryString = require("query-string");
const camelcaseKeys = require("camelcase-keys");
const createNodeHelpers = require("gatsby-node-helpers").default;

const {
  createNodeFactory,
  generateNodeId,
  generateTypeName
} = createNodeHelpers({
  typePrefix: `WebMention`
});
const ENTRY_TYPE = `Entry`;
const WebMentionEntryNode = createNodeFactory(ENTRY_TYPE, entry => ({
  ...entry,
  id: generateNodeId(ENTRY_TYPE, entry.wmId.toString())
}));

// get all mentions for a token and a specific domain
const getMentions = async ({ domain, token }) => {
  return fetch(
    `https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?${queryString.stringify({
      domain,
      token
    })}`
  )
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(mentions => {
      if (!mentions || !mentions.children) {
        return [];
      }
      return camelcaseKeys(mentions.children);
    });
};

exports.sourceNodes = async (
  { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest, reporter },
  { token, domain }
) => {
  if (!token || !domain) {
    reporter.warn(
      "`gatsby-plugin-webmention`: token and domain must be set to fetch webmentions"
    );
    reporter.warn(`is token set: ${!!token}`);
    reporter.warn(`is domain set: ${!!domain}`);
    return;
  }
  const { createNode, deleteNode } = actions;
  return getMentions({ token, domain }).then(mentions => {
    mentions.forEach(entry => createNode(WebMentionEntryNode(entry)));
  });
  //  createNode()
};
```
