In the [last post](/posts/running-a-gatsby-starter-as-a-theme) in this series, we converted the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) repo into a theme. We only made changes that were absolutely necessary so in this post we'll take a look at how starters and themes can play well together as we move the content in the theme out into a starter.

# Moving the Content

Our content is still locked in our theme, which isn't super useful to theme consumers unless they want to display the same content everywhere. Notably, in `gatsby-config.js` we have a filesystem source pointed at our theme's `content/blog` directory.

```js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    path: `${__dirname}/content/blog`,
    name: `blog`,
  },
}
```

Removing the `__dirname` prefix causes the filesystem source to look in the user's site for the `content/blog` directory.

```js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    path: `content/blog`,
    name: `blog`,
  },
},
```

We'll move the `content/blog` directory from the theme into our starter `my-blog`.

```sh
mkdir my-blog/content
mv gatsby-theme-awesome-blog/content/blog my-blog/content
```

Now, if we use our `my-blog` starter we can see that the content a user is going to modify is included int he starter, while all of the configuration is in the theme.
