Building composable themes requires a slightly different mindset than building a conventional site. Consider the following cases with one Gatsby theme and one site.

Our site is built as usual, with whatever tech we prefer, etc. We also specify a theme as such:

```js
__experimentalThemes: ["gatsby-theme-mystuff"]
```

A typical query on a site can look like this. Note that there's nothing inherently wrong with this query, it sorts by the publish date, filters out draft posts. When using the same query in a site however, there's one main aspect of this query that becomes problematic quickly: `allMdx`.

```graphql
{
  allMdx(
    sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
    filter: { frontmatter: { draft: { ne: true } } }
  ) { ... }
}
```

To understand why `allMdx` is problematic in a themes setting, consider the scenario where you have blog posts in `content/posts` and pages that you've written using MDX in `src/pages`. The blog posts need to be pulled into the Gatsby node system using `gatsby-source-filesystem` and to add a table of contents to our `src/pages` pages, we put another `gatsby-source-filesystem` on `src/pages`. So we end up with a config like this in our `gatsby-config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
	plugins: [{
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `content/posts`,
        name: `posts`
      }
    },{
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `src/pages`
      }
    }]
}
```

So the query we've written collects *all* of the `Mdx` nodes across both filesystem sources, which is not likely to be what we want. The problem gets worse when you introduce plugins like [gatsby-transformer-react-docgen](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/cfc5126ba604ceaaf561d51007d6b67d115106b3/packages/gatsby-transformer-react-docgen), which generate Mdx nodes into the Gatsby system. This causes even more content to match our query.

To fix this, we can take a variety of different paths. One is to change the query to an `allFile` query. Functionally, this is a similar query as our original `allMdx` query. The main differences are that we end up fetching drafts as well and we have to programmatically sort after we fetch as well.

```js
allFile(filter: { sourceInstanceName: { eq: "posts" } }) {
  edges {
    node {
      childMdx {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

One unfortunate consequence of this is that it locks us into using files as our data source. If someone is using a headless CMS then they can't use our theme with this query because we are now querying the *source* of our content instead of the *format*.

# createNodeField

We can solve this problem by adding a new field to our content: `isNote`. This is the ultimate in flexibility because it allows us to define whatever we want as the criteria for what constitutes a Note.

```js
exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === `Mdx`) {
    const parent = getNode(node.parent);

    if (parent.internal.type === "File" && parent.internalSourceName === "posts") {
	  createNodeField({
	    name: `isNote`,
	    node,
	    value: true
	  });
    }
  }
};
```
