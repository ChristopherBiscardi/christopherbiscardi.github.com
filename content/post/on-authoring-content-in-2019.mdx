Over the last couple months I've produced a lot of content. In January 2019, it was one post every day while in February and March I kept a writing pace with a weekly newsletter and published less on my own blog (while publishing more on *other* people's blogs.

# 2018

I've always liked producing content, whether that was written or video based. . I self-published a (now fairly outdated) book in 2013/14.

Jan (cranking out a post a day in about an hour). Moved to having custom ooengraph images, which placed more of a barrier to shipping. Turned out to be enough of a barrier to be a problem.

Feb (content for other platforms. MDX and Gatsby blog). Takes longer to write, can't ship as fast (review process), sometimes requires significant development cost before a post is worth it. (TD: tie code commit size to blog post size)

March, helping to build a [digital garden](https://github.com/johno/digital-garden) with [@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine/status/1106643897856360448) to enhance process.

I used to think that sitting down and just writing a bunch, then going back to edit was a good way to produce content. In some ways that's good and in others it spins out of control and I have a tendency to write book chapter length posts that take months to ship (TD: link to Styles and Naming)
