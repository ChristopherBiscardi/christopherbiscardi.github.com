When I wrote
[Styled System on React Hooks](/post/styled-system-on-react-hooks)
I explored what it might look like in the near future to
consume a theme context provided by the conventional
`<ThemeProvider/>` through the pane of styled-system and
React Hooks. In reality, we don't need `ThemeProvider` as
part of our CSS-in-JS package either. Which means we can
split it out, chop it up, and

note: This post was inspired by
[a pull request](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/973)
and some conversation with

# ThemeProvider

So let's start at the beginning. For those who aren't
already aware the typical theme process uses something like
this:

```js
const theme = {
  color: 'red',
  padding: [],
  ...etc
}

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  {children}
</ThemeProvider>
```

Then `styled` components can access the theme through
interpolation:

```js
const Headline = styled.h1`
  color: ${props => props.theme.color};
  font-family: sans-serif;
`;
```

and css prop can access through a function

```js
<p css={theme => ({ color: theme.color })}>I'm also red!</p>
```

This has a couple of different issues such as needing to
wrap components in a `ThemeProvider` when testing,
over-reliance on direct use of token values instead of
building component-level APIs, etc

# No more ThemeProvider?

So if we're not locked in to using a single `ThemeProvider`
package, what if we still want to use that approach, either
because we like it and don't need much different or because
we want to migrate to a more modular approach where themes
come from multiple contexts. Well, that uses React's context
support directly and hooks.

```js
import { createContext, useContext } from "react";
const defaultTheme = {
  colors: {
    primary: "hotpink",
    secondary: "green"
  }
};
let ThemeContext = createContext(defaultTheme);
export const ThemeProvider = ThemeContext.Provider;
export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);
```

We take a set of default values and create a new theme
context. Then we export a provider and a hook that uses the
context. This allows us to statically type the values our
theme accepts (something that could be more troublesome in
the old `ThemeProvider`) so when the defaults are replaced
by a user, we keep our types.

# Splitting it up

One interesting facet of themes is that the theme object
typically becomes a merging of component-level token API
translations and generic design tokens. Sometimes this even
goes so far as to create "JSON Specs" for the colors and
sizing.

An `OutlineButton`, for example, might expose knobs to
change the color of the border and text at the same time. We
could call this `color` and it could be associated with a
variant like `primary`, `secondary`, etc.

Our `OutlineButton` can now expose this via its own context
and we can translate our theme tokens into buttons.

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from "button";
import theme from "our-tokens";

const buttons = {
  variants: {
    primary: {
      color: theme.brand
    },
    secondary: {
      color: "black"
    }
  }
};

export default ({ children }) => (
  <ThemeProvider value={buttons}>{children}</ThemeProvider>
);
```

We've now allowed the `OutlineButton` to expose an API for
changing values that we can map our generic tokens onto in
an explicit way. If we need another `OutlineButton`, we can
construct another using our design tokens and now we also
have a list of all the `OutlineButton`s in wide use.

We could also grab `our-theme` from context as well to do
the translation in a slightly different place and allow any
overrides that have been made to the core tokens to be used
(such as a new products brand color).

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from "button";
import { useTheme } from "our-tokens";

export default ({ children }) => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  return (
    <ThemeProvider
      value={{
        variants: {
          primary: { color: theme.brand },
          secondary: { color: "black" }
        }
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

# NPM Components

By using native context APIs (through hooks) we can avoid
property conflicts between different NPM packages. We can
ship themes using the names that make the most sense, not
prefixed with the component name because the context is our
namespace.

The point here isn't that we should immediately go off and
split all of our themes up into a million little contexts.
It is more that we've opened up some additional design space
relating to how we build and distribute components. We can
explore how to compose multiple disparate components into a
usable, distributable collection that leverages our brand
and our types.
