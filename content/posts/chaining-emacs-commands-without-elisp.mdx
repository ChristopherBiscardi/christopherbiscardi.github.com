# Before and After

As part of splitting a React component into its own file,
Let's take this file

```js
import styled from "react-emotion";

class Message extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <tr
        onClick={() => {
          this.onMessageSelected(msg.id);
        }}
        key={msg.id}
        className={cx(
          "cabana-meta-messages-list-item",
          this.selectedMessageClass(msg.id)
        )}
      >
        <td>{msg.frame ? msg.frame.name : "undefined"}</td>
        <td>{msg.id}</td>
        <td>{msg.entries.length}</td>
        <td>
          <div className="cabana-meta-messages-list-item-bytes">
            <MessageBytes
              key={msg.id}
              message={msg}
              seekIndex={this.props.seekIndex}
              seekTime={this.props.seekTime}
              live={this.props.live}
            />
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    );
  }
}
```

and remove the `msg.` "namespace" so we can destructure the
variables from `this.props`.

```js
import styled from "react-emotion";

class Message extends Component {
  render() {
    const { id, frame, entries } = this.props;
    return (
      <tr
        onClick={() => {
          this.onMessageSelected(id);
        }}
        key={msg.id}
        className={cx(
          "cabana-meta-messages-list-item",
          this.selectedMessageClass(id)
        )}
      >
        <td>{frame ? frame.name : "undefined"}</td>
        <td>{id}</td>
        <td>{entries.length}</td>
        <td>
          <div className="cabana-meta-messages-list-item-bytes">
            <MessageBytes
              key={id}
              message={msg}
              seekIndex={this.props.seekIndex}
              seekTime={this.props.seekTime}
              live={this.props.live}
            />
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    );
  }
}
```

# Command Explanation

I'm using [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) and
[multiple-cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el)
to do this.

The command sequence is as such:

```
C-s msg.\w+
C-7 M-<left> M-<del> M-d C-y
C-g M-gg 6
C-o C-o C-o C-o C-o C-o
C-x r y
C-SPC C-p C-p C-p C-p C-p
M-x delete-duplicate-lines
C-r $ <ret> , <ret>
```

Command by command that is:

- `C-s msg.\w+`
  - Use swiper to search for a regex matching `msg.\w+`
- `C-7`
  - With search results, insert a cursor at each match
- `M-<left> M-<del> M-d C-y`
  - delete `msg.` then put the `\w+` part in the kill ring.
- `C-g M-gg 6`
  - Exit multiple-cursors and go to line 6 (where our
    destructuring will be)
- `C-o C-o C-o C-o C-o C-o`
  - make space so we can yank-rectangle, which otherwise
    inserts without moving other lines around.
- `C-x r y`
  - `yank-rectangle` to put all matches in place
- `C-SPC C-p C-p C-p C-p C-p`
  - select the matches that we just inserted as a region
- `M-x delete-duplicate-lines`
  - unique the list of matches
- `C-r $ <ret> , <ret>`
  - use regex replace to insert a `,` at the end of each
    line.
- `C-x C-s`
  - save the buffer, which I have set to trigger prettier-js
    which nicely formats the extra space, etc

# Unsolved Problems

#### Multiple Cursors

multiple-cursors only lets you have one cursor per line when
using `swiper-mc`, which means lines like the following will
only apply to the first `msg.\w+` match.

```js
<td>{msg.frame ? msg.frame.name : "undefined"}</td>
```

This seems to be related to how swiper shows multiple
matches on a single line.

If we look at the definition of `swiper-mc`, we see some
indication that it could be the way swiper handles
candidates itself, since we create a cursor for every
candidate.

```lisp
(defun swiper-mc ()
  "Create a fake cursor for each `swiper' candidate."
  (interactive)
  (unless (require 'multiple-cursors nil t)
    (error "Multiple-cursors isn't installed"))
  (unless (window-minibuffer-p)
    (error "Call me only from `swiper'"))
  (let ((cands (nreverse ivy--old-cands)))
    (unless (string= ivy-text "")
      (ivy-exit-with-action
       (lambda (_)
         (let (cand)
           (while (setq cand (pop cands))
             (swiper--action cand)
             (when cands
               (mc/create-fake-cursor-at-point))))
         (multiple-cursors-mode 1))))))
```

I'll probably dig into that at some point.

#### C-o & C-p

`C-o` and `C-p` repeatedly are functionally useful but
cumbersome. It would be nice to have a `yank-rectangle` that
pushed other content down. Perhaps doable via transferring a
rectangle to the kill-ring instead. This will require elisp
afaict. This would get rid of the excessive `C-o` ing but
what I really want is to not have to think about how many
lines are being inserted.

The `C-p` I'm referring to is mostly for expanding regions.
I bet there's a better option somewhere to find but I
haven't looked for it yet.

# Fin

All in all I think I refactor enough code to make the
investment in writing some elisp to turn a series of object
property accesses into a destructured expression, but its
interesting to note how far we can get without writing any
elisp at all and instead combining assorted existing
commands.

Another thing that I learned in this process was
`occur-mode` and swiper's occur functionality. This lets you
take all of the results of a swiper search (`C-s`) and put
them in a new buffer and perform actions on them. The
default action seems to be "take me to the place in the
buffer where the search result is" which is hella cool for
working through a large codebase tracking function names
down, etc. Thanks for that pointer,
