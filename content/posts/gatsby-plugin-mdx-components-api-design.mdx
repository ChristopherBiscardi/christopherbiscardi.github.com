Currently there's an issue that can pop up with respect to
MDX and compatibility with the wider Remark ecosystem.
Remark AST transformations often assume HTML semantics and
thus don't handle the case where valid JavaScript escape
sequences can occur and need to be escaped. While this is a
problem that should still be solved for wider ecosystem
compatibility, we have a more powerful option available to
us when using MDX: Compoennts.

## Components for Remark users

I've begun work on a set of components that are going to be
drop-in replacements for gatsby-remark plugins where
appropriate. This list includes plugins such as
`gatsby-remark-prismjs` and
`gatsby-remark-autolink-headers`. Some plugins don't make
sense to implement like this currently, such as
`gatsby-remark-images`, because these plugins use Gatsby
APIs to optimize images, etc.

Since I practice README-first API design, This brings up an
interesting point of API design quite early in the process.
The core idea is something like this:

- [component package] Create a component that replicates the
  functionality of a Remark plugin
  - This component could be imported and used on it's own
- [gatsby plugin] The above component is then configurable
  in a gatsby plugin
- Gatsby plugin inserts the configured components into an
  `MDXProvider` using the `wrapRootElement` APIs.

In the end, what we end up with is:

```js
const components = {
  pre: MDXPrismJSComponent
};

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => (
  <MDXProvider components={components}>
    {element}
  </MDXProvider>
);
```

We have the following two options when it comes to how we
require users to use gatsby plugins for these components.

```javascript
modules.exports = {
  plugins: [`gatsby-mdx`, `gatsby-plugin-mdx-prismjs`]
};
```

```javascript
modules.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-mdx`,
      options: { plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-mdx-prismjs`] }
    }
  ]
};
```

That is, do we want to nest `MDXProviders` or not. The first
plugin API option lets us include an arbitrary number of
`MDXProviders` at the root of the tree, which implicitly
lets us also consume any potential components above our
position in the tree and defer to another component later if
we want to. It would look something like this for
implementation (simplified here, it would be multiple
`wrapRootElement` calls from multiple plugins).

```js
const components = {
  pre: MDXPrismJSComponent
};

const nestedComponents = {
  h1: MDXAutoLinkHeaders
};

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => (
  <MDXProvider components={components}>
    <MDXProvider>{element}</MDXProvider>
  </MDXProvider>
);
```

We could, as we said before, progressively enhance
components over time. If we originally only used the PrismJS
component, we could add a
[ReactLive](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live)
component by including it in a lower position in the plugin
list.

```js
const components = {
  pre: withMDXComponents(
    ({ components, live, ...props }) => {
      const OriginalPre = components.pre;
      if (live) {
        return <ReactLive {...props} />;
      } else {
        return <OriginalPre {...props} />;
      }
    }
  )
};
```

This is sort of complicated for people to understand and is
not obvious if you're going to write an MDX component plugin
for the first time. Instead what we can do is make this API
explicit and documented, then merge the result into a single
`components` object and use a single `MDXProvider`. The
default export for the gatsby-plugin-mdx components would be
an object matching the `MDXProvider` spec. (Take the
following PrismJS example).

```js
export default {
  pre: PrismJSComponent
};
```

Then we say "Do what you want, and return undefined if you
don't want to handle it", which allows us to handle the
passthrough inside of `gatsby-mdx` in a more complex way
(which could let us optimize a bit more) instead of pushing
the complexity onto component plugin authors. Our
`ReactLive` implementation now becomes simpler:

```js
const components = {
	pre: ({ live, ...props }) => {
      if(live) {
        return <ReactLive {...props} />
      } else {
        return undefined
      }
	})
}
```

and also handles the "lazy" case where someone just wants to
not deal with anything but conditionally using their own
component.

```js
const components = {
	pre: ({ live, ...props }) => {
      if(live) {
        return <ReactLive {...props} />
      }
	})
}
```

In `gasby-mdx` we could basically write some code to attempt
to render each component and if it returns `undefined`, try
the next component (otherwise pass it through to usage).

This is ok, but we can also make this a bit more explicit
too by adding guards. An example guard for the `ReactLive`
component would be:

```js
export const guards = {
  pre: ({ live }) => !!live
};
```

Then in `gatsby-mdx`, we can write code that operates more
like:

```js
const pre = [
  {
    guard: reactLiveGuard,
    Component: ReactLive
  },
  {
    guard: undefined,
    Component: PrismJS
  },
  {
    guard: undefined,
    Component: "pre"
  }
];

const components = {
  pre: props => {
    pre.find(({ guard, Component }) => {
      if (!guard || guard(props)) {
        return <Component {...props} />;
      }
    });
  }
};
```

This allows us explicit composition while also falling back
to always render something. Some components can completely
take over rendering, like `PrismJS`, while others can only
take over if we use a specific style code block:

    ```js live
    const some = {}
    ```

## Fin

So that's some of the API design I've been mulling over over
the last day or so for gatsby-mdx. This should lead to a
nice set of packages like `gatsby-mdx-plugin-defaults` and
`gatsby-mdx-plugin-from-remark` that are drop-in
enhancements to the default MDX experience and make it
easier to port code from Remark.
