This could be a long post about the motivations of people
who stream and how if you stream you will become a better
engineer, a more empathetic person, etc In reality I know
you probably want to stream or at least are already open to
the idea because you clicked on this blog post. To that end
I will give you the only advice that matters.

## Click the Go Live Button.

Nothing else matters. The more you click the Go Live button
the better you'll get and the more fun it will be. You'll
start to build a community if you do it consistently and
that community becomes self-reinforcing. Your equipment
doesn't matter, your choice of music or overlays doesn't
matter, just click the damn button and start doing the
thing.
