This week we've been going over multi-package repo tools.
Today I want to share a workflow that is enabled by those
tools, even across different tooling.

Some of the work I do on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
requires me to work on the core `gatsby` package or a small
number of other packages. I don't need to bootstrap the
entire repo, but I do need specific packages.

## The Workflow

When I work on
[Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-11-11-introducing-gatsby-themes/),
I usually use a repo called
[gatsby-theme-examples](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-examples).
This repo is set up as a multi-package repo using Yarn
Workspaces. `gatsby-theme-examples` includes a couple of
themes and a couple of usages of said themes, so when I work
on new functionality like
[child theming](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/10787),
there's a
[PR on gatsby-theme-examples](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-examples/pull/13)
that uses that functionality.

I handle both of these PRs to separate repos in the same
multi-package repo that spans two git repos. The setup looks
like this

```
git clone git@github.com:ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-examples.git
cd gatsby-theme-examples
mkdir vendored-gatsby
cd vendored-gatsby
git clone git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby.git
```

I clone the gatsby repo into a sub-directory of the examples
repo, then point the Yarn Workspaces config in the theme
examples `package.json` to include the packages I need. By
default the workspaces config looks like

```js
{
  "name": "gatsby-theme-examples",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "christopherbiscardi <chris@christopherbiscardi.com> (@chrisbiscardi)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "themes/*",
    "ui-surfaces/*"
  ]
}
```

When working with a forked Gatsby repo I add the packages I
need, so if all I need is `gatsby`, it looks like

```js
{
  "name": "gatsby-theme-examples",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "christopherbiscardi <chris@christopherbiscardi.com> (@chrisbiscardi)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "themes/*",
    "ui-surfaces/*",
    "vendored-gatsby/packages/gatsby"
  ]
}
```

Then I run `yarn` to install all dependencies in the
examples repo _and_ `gatsby`. Since `gatsby` requires a
build, I then run `yarn workspace gatsby build` to build the
package and it's already linked into my themes repo for
experimentation.

## Fin

This is a really powerful workflow that allows me to reduce
the expensiveness of working with multi-package repos I
don't necessarily control. It is so useful to be able to
mount repos into each other when developing that I've
started starting all my new repositories as multi-package
repos using Yarn Workspaces. I've been doing this workflow
for awhile now and it makes the cost of migrating packages
across repos, working on multiple repos, and modifying
forked packages much simpler. If you plan on starting a new
project this year, I'd suggest trying to start it using Yarn
Workspaces as it doesn't require much overhead at all and it
enables a lot of flexibility.
