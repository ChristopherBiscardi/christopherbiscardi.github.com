FaunaDB is a geo-replicated database in the style of
[Spanner](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanner_(database)>)
and
[Calvin](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/29/calvin-fast-distributed-transactions-for-partitioned-database-systems/).
It includes a GraphQL integration natively, is multi-tenant
by default (using nested databases), and has a powerful
query language based in lambda calculus called FQL.

Also check out the
[Jepsen analysis](https://jepsen.io/analyses/faunadb-2.5.4)
and the [consistency models](https://jepsen.io/consistency)
chart if you're unfamiliar with consistency models.

Most interestingly is that it's bonkers easy to set up a new
database for a project (ymmv, statment is subject to chance
and experience, void where prohibited).

## A first document insertion

My use case for fauna is a Golang lambda function that I
deploy on Netlify that runs once a day at 11am. I would like
to store the Dev Tip that gets tweeted out somewhere so that
I can prevent it from being tweeted again within a week or
two of the last time it was tweeted out.

First, I created a `FaunaTweetResult` type complete with
fauna tags.

```go
type FaunaTweetResult struct {
	DevTipID       string `fauna:"devTipId"`
	TweetID        string `fauna:"tweetId"`
	TweetContent   string `fauna:"tweetContent"`
	TweetCreatedAt string `fauna:"tweetCreatedAt"`
	RetweetCount   int    `fauna:"retweetCount"`
	FavoriteCount  int    `fauna:"favoriteCount"`
}
```

Then I instantiated a fake tweet that matches the output of
the function I'm using to send the tweet in
[anaconda](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda)

```go
faunaTweet := FaunaTweetResult{
	DevTipID:       "somethingtip",
	TweetID:        "some tweet id",
	TweetContent:   "some tweet",
	TweetCreatedAt: "a date",
	RetweetCount:   0,
	FavoriteCount:  0,
}
```

Next comes the token fetch from the environment and client
instantiation for fauna. You can create sub-clients using
alternate secrets which is interesting but I didn't have a
use case for it yet.

```go
faunaToken, _ := os.LookupEnv("FAUNA_TOKEN")
client := f.NewFaunaClient(faunaToken)
```

Finally we write some
[FQL](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/) looking
code and pass in our faked tweet to insert a new document
into our fauna database.

```go
newTweetRecord, faunaErr := client.Query(
	f.Create(
	  // f.Class will be f.Collection soon
		f.Class("dev-tip-tweets"),
		f.Obj{"data": faunaTweet},
	)
)
```

and that's it. We were successfully inserting docs into the
database in about an hours worth of work, having never
worked with the platform before.

---

It was pretty fun to throw my proverbial hat in the faunadb
ring and I'll be working with it more in the future. My next
task is to tackle querying so that I can develop a better
mental model for how to architect data for this system.
