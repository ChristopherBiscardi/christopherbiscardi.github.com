Let's say you have a repo full of a set of NPM packages,
such as a Yarn Workspaces setup. How do you publish those
packages? With GitHub Actions we can automate the creation
of changesets as well as the version bumping and publishing
of the packages affected by those changesets.

## Changesets

Assuming we have a pre-existing Yarn workspaces setup, we
first we need to set up
[changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) using
the changesets cli.

```sh
yarn add @changesets/cli
yarn changeset init
```

on init, you should see something like this:

```
yarn run v1.19.0
$ /Users/chris/github/christopherbiscardi/gatsby-plugins/node_modules/.bin/changeset init
🦋  Thanks for choosing changesets to help manage your versioning and publishing
🦋
🦋  You should be set up to start using changesets now!
🦋
🦋  info We have added a `.changeset` folder, and a couple of files to help you out:
🦋  info - .changeset/README.md contains information about using changesets
🦋  info - .changeset/config.json is our default config
✨  Done in 0.96s.
```

The created `.changesets/config.json` looks something like
this:

```
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@changesets/config@0.2.1/schema.json",
  "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog",
  "commit": false,
  "linked": [],
  "access": "private"
}
```

## Creating our first changeset

A changeset is created using the `changeset` CLI.

```sh
yarn changeset
```

When run, we get a number of questions about which packages
are affected and what semver range this changeset should
bump (major, minor, or patch).

```
➜ yarn changeset
yarn run v1.19.0
$ /Users/chris/github/christopherbiscardi/gatsby-plugins/node_modules/.bin/changeset

```

The content of `.changeset/silly-dragons-retire.md` turns
out to be

```md
---
"gatsby-plugin-printer": patch
---

Testing changesets PR
```

This file will get deleted automatically later (and merged
into the `CHANGELOG.md`) when we set up our GH Action PR.

## Changesets on Actions

Now that we've created our first changeset, it's time to set
GitHub Actions up. The changesets GH Action will create a PR
including all of the version bumps and `CHANGELOG.md`s that
need to happen from any given changeset. We can then merge
that PR after reviewing and release it how we wish. Here's
the config for the action, including two independent jobs:
one that builds and tests while the other creates the
changeset PR. We're only running on merge to master so we
don't have to worry about PRs creating errant changeset PRs.

```yaml
name: Publish Packages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn test

  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Create Release Pull Request
        uses: changesets/action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Publishing with lerna

Finally we'll add publishing support to our GitHub action
workflow. In this case I've set it up to publish to `npm`
_and_ `gpr`. To publish to `gpr` you may need to follow
additional instructions not included here.

```yaml
name: Publish Packages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn test

  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Create Release Pull Request
        uses: changesets/action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  publish-npm:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn publish-ci
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.npm_token}}

  publish-gpr:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12
          registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com/
          scope: "@christopherbiscardi"
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn publish-ci
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

The key difference is the `yarn publish-ci` command, which
requires a few flags such as `from-package`, which indicates
that we get our versioning from the package itself and not
git history.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "publish-ci": "lerna publish from-package -y --no-verify-access"
  }
}
```

## The Release

Now that everything is set up, a push to master with a
changeset will
[create a PR](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-plugins/pull/6)
with the package version changes and `CHANGELOG.md`s which
can then be merged to trigger lerna actually releasing the
packages to the registries.

All in all this is a fantastic workflow I anticipate using
across many of my repos. It includes the ability to publish
packages automatically while also allowing a measure of
control over when and how they get published. I can merge
the changesets PR from my phone to trigger a release!
