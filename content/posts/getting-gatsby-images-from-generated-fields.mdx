Ever since I wrote
[SEO Images with Unsplash](/post/seo-images-with-unsplash)
I've been making images for my posts, pulling the branch
down to my local computer, adding the image to the branch,
editing the frontmatter to point to the image (always a png
with the same name as the post file) and pushing it back up
to merge.

This is kind of an annoying workflow to do every day, so I
wanted to automate the finding and processing of the image
files. If I automated it instead of placing it in the
frontmatter, I could push the images up on master and merge
the blog posts in later without having to pull them down. I
handled the automation in
[this commit](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/christopherbiscardi.github.com/pull/74/files),
which also merged the
[Getting Started with Emotion](/post/getting-started-with-emotion-and-gatsby)
post (the first post to use the automatic featured image
functionality.

## Generating Fields

The first change I needed to make was to generate the
`featuredImage` field on my content nodes. I use MDX so the
resulting field will apply to MDX nodes in the
[Gatsby node system](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-interface/).

Here is the code from the change I made that checks for
`Mdx` nodes with `File` node parents. On these nodes it
checks for the existence of a file with the same name as the
`File` node that has a `.png` extension instead of a `.mdx`
extension. If the featured image file exists, we add a new
field called `featuredImage` to the MDX node with the
absolute path to the image.

```js
// gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === `Mdx`) {
    const { frontmatter } = node;
    const parent = getNode(node.parent);

    if (parent.internal.type === "File") {
      const ext = path.extname(parent.absolutePath);
      const featuredImage = parent.absolutePath.replace(
        ext,
        ".png"
      );
      if (fs.existsSync(featuredImage)) {
        createNodeField({
          name: `featuredImage`,
          node,
          value: featuredImage
        });
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## Strings and Sharp Objects

Now, that gives us a field on `Mdx` nodes that can be
queried as such:

```graphql
{
  mdx {
    fields {
      featuredImage
    }
  }
}
```

The problem is that `featuredImage` is an absolute path to a
png file and thus, is a string. We need to associate this
string with a `File` node so that we can make interesting
queries through
[the sharp transformer](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp/).
To do this, we can take advantage of a `gatsby-config.js`
key that I don't see used as often as other features:
[`mapping`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/#mapping-node-types).

To associate our field with the absolute path of the `File`
node we stick the path to our field in the `mapping` object
as a key and the path to the corresponding field on the
`File` nodes as the value. These strings are `nodeType.path`
so for `Mdx` nodes, we want the `fields.featuredImage`
property.

```js
module.exports = {
  mapping: { "Mdx.fields.featuredImage": `File.absolutePath` },
  plugins: [...]
}
```

_This_ is the magic piece that lets us query `File` nodes
for `ImageSharp` children.

```graphql
export const query = graphql`
  query {
    allMdx(limit: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          excerpt
          fields {
            slug
            featuredImage {
              id
              childImageSharp {
                fluid(maxWidth: 700) {
                  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

and now I can drop in a file without having to update the
frontmatter for my blog posts and get a nice SEO image to
use
[when I post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi)
and query for more interesting images to use on the front
page or blog post page template too.

## Fin

Now that it all works, I can go back and simplify the code
that queries for images on the frontmatter _and_ the
`fields` so that it just needs to look for
`fields.featuredImage`. I can do this by pulling the
processing back into the `onCreateNode` lifecycle and
checking to see if there's a `frontmatter.featuredImage`.
