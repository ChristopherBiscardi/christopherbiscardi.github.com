[Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/)
is an integrated authorization solution for Netlify that
allows users to sign up, log in, and also provides the
verified user object inside of Netlify Functions.

Sometimes we'll need to use Netlify Identity on other
platforms, like AWS. This is the case if we need websocket
support or want to take advantage of AWS IAM. In these cases
we can still use Netlify Identity as our source of truth as
our application scales up by taking advantage of custom
authorizers.

## What's an authorizer?

> A Lambda authorizer (formerly known as a custom
> authorizer) is an API Gateway feature that uses a Lambda
> function to control access to your API.

There are two types of authorizers: token based and request
parameter based. We are going to use a token authorizer in
this post, but you'll need a request parameter authorizer if
you're using websockets.

Let's say we have a GraphQL API running on AWS Lambda. An
authorizer sits in front of our GraphQL API, checks the
bearer token for us, then returns an IAM policy indicating
whether or not the request should be handled by the GraphQL
server, or denied. AWS then evaluates the policy and either
forwards the request to the GraphQL server, or doesn't.

## Implementation

If you play around with an existing Netlify identity
instance and
[the GoTrue Playground](https://gotruejs-playground.netlify.com/),
what you end up realizing is that to get the user data is a
_single_ HTTP call. This makes our authorizer implementation
very small.

- Get the token
- Get the user
- If the user isn't valid, throw
- If the user is valid, return the policy

```js
module.exports = async params => {
  const token = getToken(params);
  const user = await getJSON(
    "https://serverless-todo-netlify-fauna-egghead.netlify.com/.netlify/identity/user",
    null,
    { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
  );
  if (!user.id) {
    throw new Error("Netlify Identity Failed");
  }
  return {
    principalId: user.id,
    policyDocument: getPolicyDocument(
      "Allow",
      params.methodArn
    )
  };
};
```

## Getting the bearer token

As long as the token is sent in the Authorization header as
a bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer my-token`, when
getting the token string from the params is fairly
mechanical.

```js
const getToken = params => {
  if (!params.type || params.type !== "TOKEN") {
    throw new Error(
      'Expected "event.type" parameter to have value "TOKEN"'
    );
  }

  const tokenString = params.authorizationToken;
  if (!tokenString) {
    throw new Error(
      'Expected "event.authorizationToken" parameter to be set'
    );
  }

  const match = tokenString.match(/^Bearer (.*)$/);
  if (!match || match.length < 2) {
    throw new Error(
      `Invalid Authorization token - ${tokenString} does not match "Bearer .*"`
    );
  }
  return match[1];
};
```

## Policies

We use the `2012-10-17`
[IAM policy version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_version.html)
to say that the user is allowed to invoke an effect on a
specific resource. In our case above, we decided to `Allow`
invoking the next lambda:
`getPolicyDocument("Allow", params.methodArn)`.

```js
const getPolicyDocument = (effect, resource) => {
  const policyDocument = {
    Version: "2012-10-17", // default version
    Statement: [
      {
        Action: "execute-api:Invoke", // default action
        Effect: effect,
        Resource: resource
      }
    ]
  };
  return policyDocument;
};
```

## Bent

Perhaps less interesting, I want to call out the use of
[Bent](https://github.com/mikeal/bent) in this example,
which has been fantastic to use.

```js
const bent = require("bent");
const getJSON = bent("GET", "json");
const user = await getJSON(
  "https://serverless-todo-netlify-fauna-egghead.netlify.com/.netlify/identity/user",
  null,
  { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
);
```

## Thanks

Special thanks to
[David Wells](https://twitter.com/DavidWells), whose
[auth0 authorizer ](https://github.com/serverless/forms-service/blob/d260e45c75389f4a09524d518d4dd43e53a15375/backend/lib/auth.js)
was one of the first I worked with.
