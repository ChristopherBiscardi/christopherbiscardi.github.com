SlateJS can render arbitrary elements as long as the leaf
nodes are `text`. This means we can construct arbitrary JSON
trees of to represent our content and let
[Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/) handle the rest.

```js
import React, { useMemo } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
// Import the Slate editor factory.
import { createEditor } from "slate";
// Import the Slate components and React plugin.
import { Slate, Editable, withReact } from "slate-react";

const defaultValue = [
  {
    type: "stuff",
    children: [
      {
        text: "A line of text in a paragraph.",
        marks: []
      }
    ]
  }
];

const App = () => {
  const editor = useMemo(
    () => withReact(createEditor()),
    []
  );
  return (
    // Add the default value as a prop to the editor context.
    <Slate editor={editor} defaultValue={defaultValue}>
      <Editable />
    </Slate>
  );
};
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

This works because the default React element used to render
a Slate element is a `div`. Note the contents of the
`data-slate-node` attributes in the resulting HTML.

```html
<div
  data-gramm="false"
  role="textbox"
  data-slate-editor="true"
  data-slate-node="value"
  contenteditable="true"
  style="outline: none; white-space: pre-wrap; overflow-wrap: break-word;"
>
  <div
    data-slate-node="element"
    style="position: relative;"
  >
    <span data-slate-node="text"
      ><span data-slate-leaf="true"
        ><span data-slate-string="true"
          >A line of text in a paragraph.</span
        ></span
      ></span
    >
  </div>
</div>
```

The `type` field isn't special, we could name it whatever we
wanted. The `children` field is important and needs to
exist. This is part of the
[`Node` interfaces](https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/02-nodes).

the tldr; is that your elements need to have `children` and
your `Text` nodes need to have `text` and `marks`.
Everything else is up to you from how to structure your tree
to anything else relating to the keys that make up that
tree.

```graphql
interface Element {
  children: Node[]
}

interface Text {
  text: string
  marks: Mark[]
}
```
