Lately I've been doing some work with the
[GraphQL SDL](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51)
and [graphql-js][graphql-js] (because it's for
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and Gatsby is
JavaScript). This post is an attempt to demystify some of
the code inside of graphql-js. We're not starting at the
beginning so buckle up.

## Schema Definition Language

The GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language) is a custom
language for defining GraphQL schemas. It looks like this:

```graphql
type BlogPost {
  title: String!
  body: String
  excerpt: String
  date: String
  tags: [String]
}

type Post {
  title: String
}
```

The idea behind the SDL is that you can use these types to
define your API types for Query, Mutation, or Subscription.
Then you have to implement resolvers that match these types
(or can auto-generate them in advanced use cases). We're
only working with "fragments" of GraphQL schema today, not a
full API, so we won't get into what this looks like in a
larger context.

Since this is a custom language it means we need a way to
represent it in JavaScript to do anything more than logging
it out. Enter [graphql-js][graphql-js].

## parse

[graphql-js][graphql-js] is (TODO:). The package has a
`language` module built in which is responsible for defining
the [lexer][lexer] and [parser][parser] for the SDL. Gatsby
[re-exports this package](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/4fc1d45bcfe19790c8a94267f2a8d1cd38891a95/packages/gatsby/graphql.js)
with an additional JSON datatype so we have to make sure we
only import one of the packages' `graphql`s because you can
only have one graphql-js (_why_ you can only have one
version installed is a story for another day and is a
limitation of `graphql-js` itself).

We can write a small program to parse the schema into a JSON
format.

```js
const { parse } = require("graphql/language");

const schema = `
  type BlogPost {
    title: String!
    body: String
    excerpt: String
    date: String
    tags: [String]
  }

  type Post {
    title: String
  }
`;

console.log(parse(schema));
```

Remember how we said we were only dealing with "fragments"
of GraphQL? In this case it turns out to be the `Document`
type for the entire file. The `Document` holds our two type
declarations in an array called `definitions` alongside a
bunch of other relevant data for each type and the code
location the type occurs in.

```json
{
  "kind": "Document",
  "definitions": [
    {
      "kind": "ObjectTypeDefinition",
      "description": undefined,
      "name": [Object],
      "interfaces": [],
      "directives": [],
      "fields": [Array],
      "loc": [Object]
    },
    {
      "kind": "ObjectTypeDefinition",
      "description": undefined,
      "name": [Object],
      "interfaces": [],
      "directives": [],
      "fields": [Array],
      "loc": [Object]
    }
  ],
  "loc": { "start": 0, "end": 129 }
}
```

The less complex of the two is our `Post` type. We can see
that it's an `Object` type with a`name` of `Post`. It has no
`interfaces` and no `directives` and a single `Field`. On
our `Field`, we get the name and return type of the field
(`title` and `String`)

```json
{
  kind: "ObjectTypeDefinition",
  name: { kind: "Name", value: "Post", loc: { start: 123, end: 127 } },
  interfaces: [],
  directives: [],
  fields: [
    {
      kind: "FieldDefinition",
      name: { kind: "Name", value: "title", loc: { start: 134, end: 139 } },
      arguments: [],
      type: {
        kind: "NamedType",
        name: { kind: "Name", value: "String", loc: { start: 141, end: 147 } },
        loc: { start: 141, end: 147 }
      },
      directives: [],
      loc: { start: 134, end: 147 }
    }
  ],
  loc: { start: 118, end: 151 }
};
```

If we change the `title` field on the `Post` to a required
field.

```js
type Post {
  title: String!
}
```

The `FieldDefinition` return type changes to a `NonNullType`
with a `NamedType` inside of it.

```json
{
  "kind": "FieldDefinition",
  "name": {
    "kind": "Name",
    "value": "title",
    "loc": { "start": 134, "end": 139 }
  },
  "arguments": [],
  "type": {
    "kind": "NonNullType",
    "type": {
      "kind": "NamedType",
      "name": {
        "kind": "Name",
        "value": "String",
        "loc": { "start": 141, "end": 147 }
      },
      "loc": { "start": 141, "end": 147 }
    },
    "loc": { "start": 141, "end": 148 }
  },
  "directives": [],
  "loc": { "start": 134, "end": 148 }
}
```

And now that we have our type declarations in JavaScript, we
can traverse them to find all the fields and print them.
`graphql-js/language` contains two additional functions to
help us with this: `visit` and `print`.

`visit` allows us to define a set of nodes to process. We
can change them here too but in this case we'll just
pretty-print them. Since we're clearly working with an
[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)
now, we'll name our argument in the `forEach` `ast` which we
expect to be each of the Object types we've defined.

```js
const { parse, visit, print } = require("graphql/language");

const schema = `
  type BlogPost {
    title: String!
    body: String
    excerpt: String
    date: String
    tags: [String]
  }

  type Post {
    title: String!
  }
`;

parse(schema).definitions.forEach(ast => {
  console.log("\n");
  console.log(ast.name.value);
  visit(ast, {
    FieldDefinition(node) {
      console.log(print(node));
    }
  });
});
```

will return the name of each node and the fields they
contain.

```
BlogPost
title: String!
body: String
excerpt: String
date: String
tags: [String]


Post
title: String!
```

This may not seem like much, but it allows us to define data
types and programmatically manipulate them. We could use
this information to create an ORM for a database, for
example.

If you want to explore the AST more without having to write
your own code, I highly suggest
[AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/9bb73e8b0d49f11d0e91b21a1f52aadd/d0b34c79e824f29f7d9b1f1cee24256d3b6f484e),
which is a browser-based tool for viewing ASTs. I've added
the example in this blogpost to the AST Explorer link.
