};

When building Gatsby sites we don't run a server, so to use
any dynamic logic we can take advantage of serverless
functions. In our case we'll deploy
[on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and that means we'll
go with golang for our functions.

## Initial Project

The project we're working on is a yarn workspaces setup with
a Gatsby project in `packages/hello-world-site`. We won't be
running any of that code, it's there solely to frame the
context of deploying golang functions in the context of a
larger, multi-language project. Our filesystem layout for
our project includes a yarn lockfile, `package.json`, and
other assorted Gatsby related stuff.

```
.
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── packages
└── yarn.lock
```

## Go source code

We'll create a `go-src` directory since we'll be using go
modules to maintain our application, and a `hello-world`
directory inside of that to house our first lambda.

```sh
mkdir go-src/hello-world
```

Using Go modules means we don't have to deal with \$GOPATH
or other environment variables.

> Note: make sure `GO_IMPORT_PATH` is _not_ set in your
> environment when deploying on Netlify or go modules will
> not work and your dependencies will not be found

We will have to initialize the modules though.

```sh
go mod init
```

If you see the following message, it means
[go wasn't able to automatically determine the package](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#why-does-go-mod-init-give-the-error-cannot-determine-module-path-for-source-directory),
so you'll have to use the name when initializing.

> go: cannot determine module path for source directory
> /Users/chris/github/christopherbiscardi/golang-modules-netlify-serverless-gatsby-example
> (outside GOPATH, no import comments)

My repo will be on github at
[github.com/christopherbiscardi/golang-modules-netlify-serverless-gatsby-example](github.com/christopherbiscardi/golang-modules-netlify-serverless-gatsby-example),
so my init command is:

```sh
go mod init github.com/christopherbiscardi/golang-modules-netlify-serverless-gatsby-example
```

Our newly created `go.mod` file is pretty empty.

```
module github.com/christopherbiscardi/golang-modules-netlify-serverless-gatsby-example

go 1.12
```

Next, we'll write some code for a hello-world golang
function. In `go-src/hello-world/main.go` use the following
code.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
	"github.com/honeycombio/libhoney-go"
	"github.com/honeycombio/libhoney-go/transmission"
)

func handler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (*events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {
	// Create an event, add some data
	ev := libhoney.NewEvent()
	ev.Add(map[string]interface{}{
		"method":       request.HTTPMethod,
		"hostname":     request.Resource,
		"request_path": request.Path,
		"name":         "devtips",
	})

	// This event will be sent regardless of how we exit
	defer ev.Send()

	ev.AddField("status_code", 200)
	return &events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
		StatusCode: 200,
		Body:       "Hello, World",
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	libhoney.Init(libhoney.Config{
		// APIKey: "",
		Dataset:      "netlify-lambdas",
		Transmission: &transmission.WriterSender{},
	})
	// Flush any pending calls to Honeycomb before exiting
	defer libhoney.Close()
	// Make the handler available for Remote Procedure Call by AWS Lambda
	lambda.Start(handler)
}
```

This code does two things. The first is setting up
[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) for logging with the
stdout transmission. This lets us log out events to the
netlify console when our lambda function runs with the
option to easily switch to sending them to an aggregation
dataset later for querying if we want.

The second is our lambda handler setup. This is the code
that handles receiving and responding to events. We send
back a `Hello, World` string in response to an
`APIGatewayProxyRequest`.

## netlify setup

We'll take advantage of Netlify to build our functions (and
the existing Gatsby site). To do that we need a
`netlify.toml` (or you can use the web interface). We are
going to use Make to orchestrate our build commands. Our
functions are going to be built into a `netlify-functions`
folder. Finally, our Gatsby site will get built into
`packages/hello-world-site/public`.

```
[build]
  command = "make build"
  functions = "netlify-functions"
  publish = "packages/hello-world-site/public"
```

Then in the root of our site create a `Makefile` with a
`build` command. If you know Make well feel free to spice
this up as much as you like with targets, etc. Our build
command builds the Gatsby site first, then the go functions.

```makefile
build:
	yarn workspace site build
	GOBIN=${PWD}/netlify-functions go install ./...
```

Since `go build` doesn't let us control the location of the
resulting binaries, we use `go install` with a `GOBIN`
environment variable pointing at our `netlify-functions`
folder (which doesn't need to exist in our repo). `./...`
roughly means "build all of the binaries"; You can also
choose to manually `go build` each one.

Note that because we used `./...` we're set up to build as
many functions as we want by adding new directories in
`go-src`.

## deploying

If we test by running `make`, we get a Gatsby build followed
by a go build.

Once we push to netlify, we'll see the build logs relating
to our functions (as well as the gatsby site).

```
11:50:23 PM: Found netlify.toml. Overriding site configuration
11:50:23 PM: Different functions path detected, going to use the one specified in the toml file: 'netlify-functions' versus '' in the site

```

## Testing our Function

The function is deployed at
`https://our-site.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/hello-world`
so we'll simply visit that page to trigger the function,
seeing `Hello, World` on the page as a result.

Our function logs show that we've hit the hello-world
function

```
11:53:52 PM: hello-world invoked
11:53:52 PM: {"data":{"hostname":"","method":"GET","name":"devtips","request_path":"/.netlify/functions/hello-world","status_code":200},"time":"2019-08-23T06:53:52.833607933Z","dataset":"netlify-lambdas"}
```
