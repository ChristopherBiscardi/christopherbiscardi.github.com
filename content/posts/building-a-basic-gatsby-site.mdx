[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a fantastic tool for
building out almost any site you can think of. Due to how
flexible it is, some people find themselves looking for a
way to "just write markdown" and get a website.

So lets initialize a new project and install a couple
dependencies. Only gatsby, react, and react-dom are strictly
necessary for a gatsby site to run. To add markdown support
we'll use gatsby-mdx so that we don't have to write any
GraphQL to build new pages.

```sh
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
yarn init -y
yarn add gatsby react react-dom gatsby-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/tag
```

Now that we've installed the necessary dependencies, we need
to create a `gatsby-config.js` file. This is the core of our
gatsby site if we want to do more custom work and it will be
very small for this project.

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["gatsby-mdx"]
};
```

If we run `yarn gatsby develop` now, we'll see our gatsby
site running without any pages at all, so lets fix that.
Create a new file at `src/pages/index.mdx`. This will turn
into our home page at `/`.

```js
# Test

My index page
```

Any JavaScript file or MDX file in `src/pages` will turn
into a page at the relative path. So a new file at
`src/pages/about.mdx` will create a new page at `/about`.

That's it, run `yarn gatsby develop` and you can start
creating new pages.

# Extra

This is actually too little for a lot of people. It has no
navigation, layout, etc. To add a layout, we can create a
file at `src/components/layout.js`.

```js
import React from "react";
import "./layout.css";

const SiteLayout = ({ children, ...props }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>My Site!</h1>
    {children}
  </div>
);

export default SiteLayout;
```

and a css file at `src/components/layout.css`. I chose to
add a system font stack to mine.

```css
body {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont,
    "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif,
    "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
}
```

We'll also create two new files: `gatsby-ssr.js` and
`gatsby-browser.js`. Both files will include the exact same
content: we'll import our layout, our css, and React
(because we're using JSX syntax). Gatsby offers us an API
called `wrapRootElement` that we can use to wrap the entire
site in our layout.

```js
import React from "react";
import "./src/components/layout.css";
import Layout from "./src/components/layout";

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => (
  <Layout>{element}</Layout>
);
```

# Fin

Now in our layout we can include any navigation, layout
elements like sidebars, or anything else we want. We've
taken a bare bones approach so that we could focus on what
we wanted to build. From here, we can make our site as
custom or as bare bones as we want. We can explore learning
React or GraphQL, experiment with css-in-js, or find out
what's possible
[in the Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
We can also choose to keep everything in a single CSS file
and a single Layout file while writing Markdown in
src/pages.

If you end up with something that you like and want to
re-use, you can make a
[gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2), or
even a
[theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-11-11-introducing-gatsby-themes/).
