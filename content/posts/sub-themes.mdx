# sub-themes

"Sub themes" are themes that are used by a controlling theme
to execute logic in various lifecycles. sub-themes operate
the same as sub-plugins, which means if you've used
gatsby-transformer-remark or gatsby-plugin-mdx _and_
gatsby-remark-\* plugins like gatsby-remark-images, then
you're familiar with passing plugins to other plugins using
options.

## sub-plugins

Here's an example of sub-plugins in a gatsby config that
applies `gatsby-remark-prismjs` using
`gatsby-transformer-remark`.

```js title=gatsby-config.js
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
          options: {}
        }
      ]
    }
  }
];
```

## sub-themes

Themes are the same as plugins, so we can take advantage of
the same pattern. Note that this is mostly an advanced
pattern and you probably want to either use "sibling" themes
or "parent/child" themes instead.

Imagine a hypothetical gatsby-theme-blog that allows other
plugins to modify the core `BlogPost` interface logic to add
an additional field called "categories" to the interface.
The hypothetical `BlogPost` interface would be (in this case
it was actually taken from the current
[gatsby-theme-blog-core](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/3d2f82d6909c5ed9621f232b9746cc0196d36193/packages/gatsby-theme-blog-core/gatsby-node.js#L48-L58))

```graphql title=gatsby-node.js
interface BlogPost @nodeInterface {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  slug: String!
  date: Date! @dateformat
  tags: [String]!
  keywords: [String]!
  excerpt: String!
}
```

An extremely naiive solution that didn't use the graphql AST
or graphql-compose to construct the type could look like
(note that this logic is pseudo-code and not copy/pastable
into an implementation)

```js
const blogPostInterface = `
  interface BlogPost @nodeInterface {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    body: String!
    slug: String!
    date: Date! @dateformat
    tags: [String]!
    keywords: [String]!
    excerpt: String!
    ${options.plugins.map(plugin =>
      plugin.extend("BlogPost")
    )}
  }
`;
```

An implementation in the sub-plugin could be in a special
`gatsby-theme-blog.js` file, just like the other gatsby-\*
files. Doing this as a sub-plugin also gives us the built-in
option to export this function from the `index.js` file in
our theme as well.

```js
exports.extend = gqlType => {
  if (gqlType === "BlogPost") {
    return `categories: [String!]!`;
  } else {
    return ``;
  }
};
```

in this case our theme is allowing sub-themes to modify the
core `BlogPost` interface by injecting additional strings.
Note that there are numerous problems with this specific
approach and it's not clear that it's a good idea anyway
(but illustrates the point).

Our theme could then accept the sub-theme as an option.

```js {6-11} title=gatsby-config.js
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-theme-blog`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-theme-blog-categories`,
          options: {}
        }
      ]
    }
  }
];
```

---

post-note: If sub-themes were allowed to have a
gatsby-config, we could do things like extend categories to
be a type from WordPress, Contentful, or any other headless
CMS by adding the relevant plugin to `gatsby-config.js`.
