function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Books on My Bookshelf for 2014\",\"date\":\"Wed, 08 Jan 2014 03:00:20 +0000\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/2014/1/7/books-on-my-bookshelf-for-2014/\",\"body\":\"<p>I decided to take stock of the books that are sitting on my bookshelf for 2014. Here is that list.</p>\\n<p>Starting with some (of my) classics. These are books that I read in the middle/high school time period in my life.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Technical-Mathematics-Calculus-Edition/dp/0133116530?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Basic Technical Mathematics with Calculus</a></h4>\\n<p>(note: my version is the second edition. It looks like they’re up to the tenth)</p>\\n<p>This was a book that let me explore math on my own. It goes from trig functions through linear equations, logarithms, determinants and matrices, derivatives, integration, series expansion and differential equations. A little beyond what my AP Calc class ended up taking us through. I would suggest it if you have an interest in Mathematics and Calculus at an advanced high school level.</p>\\n<h4>Texas Instruments TI-83+ Manual</h4>\\n<p>I read this cover to cover one day. It led through the days of BASIC on a calculator in Math class, where I would program equation solvers and games.</p>\\n<h2>Distributed Systems</h2>\\n<h4>Distributed Systems Concepts and Design</h4>\\n<p>The purchase of this book was driven by my interest in Erlang and Riak Core. I was hoping that this would give me some good information on distributed systems but it’s a bit of a slog to parse the wordiness of the book. Preferable would be to surf the repos of various open source projects. The table of contents, however, is useful in pointing you to on the path to those projects.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Concurrent-Programming-Haskell-Multithreaded/dp/1449335942/?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell</a></h4>\\n<p>A solid book that takes you through parallelism and concurrency in Haskell with plenty of code to work with. Concepts covered include Data Parallel Programing, GPU programming, MVars, Software Transactional Memory and finally distributed-process, which is an attempt to create a sort of Erlang-as-a-package for Haskell.</p>\\n<h2>Databases</h2>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Readings-Database-Systems-Joseph-Hellerstein/dp/0262693143?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Readings in Database Systems</a></h4>\\n<p>Databases are not my specialty, so I use this book as some casual reading. It is a collection of academic papers relating to databases.</p>\\n<h2>Lisp, Lambda Calculus and Functional Programming</h2>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831?tag=christophe067-20\\\">An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus</a></h4>\\n<p>This is a fun book that take you through the lambda calculus with a functional slant. Includes some comparisons with Lisp and Scheme later in the book.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Pearls-Functional-Algorithm-Design-Richard/dp/0521513383?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design</a></h4>\\n<p>A nice look at functional algorithms with plenty of Haskell code. I quite enjoy this book when I’m in an algorithmic mood.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/\\\">Common Lisp</a></h4>\\n<p>Widely recognized as a great introduction to the Common Lisp language. I don’t write as much Lisp as I would like to, but having mocl around for experimentation sure helps.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://letoverlambda.com/\\\">Let Over Lambda</a></h4>\\n<p>Let Over Lambda is billed as a book about macros, in other words a book to move you from intermediate lisper to professional. I’d like to spend a little more time with Common Lisp over the next year and Let Over Lambda will be one of the books I use to do that.</p>\\n<h2>Training</h2>\\n<p>For those that don’t know, I train for Volleyball and High Jump. Having played Division 1 Volleyball in college I still enjoy training and competing at a high level. These books help me move towards my athletic goals.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Weightlifting-Programming-Winning-Coachs-Guide/dp/0980011159?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Weightlifting Programming: A Winning Coach’s Guide</a></h4>\\n<p>This is a book by a well respected coach in the weightlifting community. Since I use Olympic lifts in my training this will help me program my lifting workouts for greater effect.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/1467933120?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Overcoming Gravity</a></h4>\\n<p>I’m not a huge fan of doing bench press, bicep curls, etc. So I got this book about training gymnastics movements to supplement my Olympic lifting, especially my upper body which I don’t need excess hypertrophy on.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Abs-Ball-Approach-Building-Abdominals/dp/089281098X?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Abs on the Ball: A Pilates Approach to Building Superb Abdominals</a></h4>\\n<p>In the past I’ve found Pilates on exercise balls to be a great way to improve core strength and stability. Colleen Craig’s books have been on my shelf for awhile and I often take exercises from them. Core strength will help me in my lifts, gymnastics training and controlling my body in the air while jumping for High Jump and Volleyball.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Supple-Leopard-Preventing-Performance/dp/1936608588?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Becoming a Supple Leopard: The Ultimate Guide to Resolving Pain, Preventing Injury, and Optimizing Athletic Performance</a></h4>\\n<p>This is a book I use for preventative maintenance of joints and muscles.

In this post we’ll go over building a simple Dockerfile to deploy the project.</p>\\n<p>Make sure you’ve <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation\\\">installed docker</a></p>\\n<h2>Building the Haskell Base</h2>\\n<p>There is an effort to make a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/darinmorrison/docker-haskell/tree/docker-library\\\">docker official haskell image</a> so we’ll use that. Once it’s merged into <code>docker-library</code>, we can simply skip building the <code>docker-haskell</code> from scratch.</p>\\n<p>Clone docker-haskell and switch to the docker-library branch. (It doesn’t matter where on the computer we do this)</p>\\n<pre><code>git clone git@github<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\">.com</span>:darinmorrison/docker-haskell<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\">.git</span>\\ncd docker-haskell\\ngit checkout docker-library\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Once in the appropriate directory, we can build the image with <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build\\\"><code>docker build</code></a>. <code>-t</code> is short for <code>--tag</code>, which lets us tag an image. We’ll use <code>haskell</code> for the base name and tag it as <code>7.8</code>. Finally, the <code>.</code> tells docker where to find the dockerfile we’re building.</p>\\n<pre><code>cd <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7.8</span>\\ndocker build -t haskell:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7.8</span> .\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We can test that it worked by using <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#run\\\"><code>docker run</code></a> to spawn <code>ghci</code> as an interactive pseudo-tty.</p>\\n<pre><code>docker run -<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">i</span> -t haskell:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7.8</span> ghci\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Use <code>:q</code> to quit <code>ghci</code> as usual.</p>\\n<h1>Building our Project</h1>\\n<p>We’ll base our project on the docker image we just built.</p>\\n<p>NOTE: We can push this base image <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerrepos/#pushing-a-repository-to-docker-hub\\\">to the docker hub</a> but interestingly enough, we don’t have to (if we’re using “normal” repos; Automated Builds are a different story). We can push the final image without pushing the base image.</p>\\n<h3>Dockerfile</h3>\\n<p>Our <code>Dockerfile</code> goes in the root of the <code>auth-server/</code> folder. If you’ve built a haskell project before and are familiar with cabal sandboxes, this will be similar:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># https://github.com/darinmorrison/docker-haskell/tree/docker-library</span>\\nFROM haskell:7.8\\n\\nRUN cabal update\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Add Cabal File and deps/ folder</span>\\nADD ./auth-server.cabal /opt/auth-server/auth-server.cabal\\nADD ./deps /opt/auth-server/deps\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Create Sandbox and Add Source Deps</span>\\nRUN cd /opt/auth-server &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox init &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/io-streams-haproxy &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/snap &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/snap-core &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/snap-server &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/snap-loader-static &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/heist\\n\\nRUN cd /opt/auth-server &amp;&amp;

This is because I inserted data twice into Riak without using a VClock the second time (While I was writing this post), resulting in siblings.

We’ve defined <code>Params</code> as a <code>newtype</code> for a <code>Data.Map</code> because, making an educated guess, the keys for params won’t always be the same. We can reach this conclusion by seeing that one of the keys is an IP address (with a port number).</p>\\n<p>Another interesting piece of the response is the <code>Docs</code>. Solr seems to return the id in Solr (<code>_yz</code> is presumably for _yokozuna), the Riak Key (<code>_yz_rk</code>), the Riak Bucket Type <code>_yz_rt</code> and the Riak Bucket (<code>_yz_rb</code>). This is useful information because we will need to use riak-haskell-client (or more likely an updated fork for Riak 2.0) to retrieve the actual data.</p>\\n<p>We can now write some JSON instances and basic http code to test.

If you don’t stop and look around for a while, you could miss it.” – Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>The State of Front End Development</h3>\\n<p>Front End tools are moving fast these days. Let’s take a minute to (briefly) look at where we’re going.</p>\\n<h3>Module Systems</h3>\\n<h3>The Old Way</h3>\\n<p>From a user-facing view, the old way is to wrap code in closures.</p>\\n<pre><code>(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.myGlobal = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{};\\n}());\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>AMD</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html\\\">Why AMD?</a> is covered in other areas but suffice it to say it looks like the below and is being superseded by the ubiquity and conciseness of CommonJS.</p>\\n<pre><code>define([<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'jquery'</span>] , <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">($)</span> </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{};\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>CommonJS</h4>\\n<p>CommonJS is used in node.js which likely contributed to its rise. It is also fairly simple to read and understand. There isn’t as much boilerplate as AMD (where the define/arguments are position-sensitive and can get fairly long).</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// hello.js</span>\\nexports.hello = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Hello World'</span>\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// main.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> example = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./hello.js'</span>);\\nexample.hello();\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>ES6</h4>\\n<p>ES6 modules are usable via transpilers, in some cases <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-modules-commonjs\\\">compiling to CommonJS</a></p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span> React from <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react\\\"</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> {format} <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"util\\\"</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">export</span> {React, format <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">as</span> fmt};\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>PureScript</h4>\\n<p>PureScript <a href=\\\"http://docs.purescript.org/en/latest/modules.html\\\">modules</a> can compile to CommonJS modules.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-module\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">module</span> A <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">where</span></span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">id</span> x = x\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Implementations of Module Systems</h3>\\n<h4>RequireJS</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://requirejs.org/\\\">RequireJS</a> is an implementation of AMD. It comes with an optimizer (r.js) but many people have since moved on to CommonJS tools such as Browserify.</p>\\n<h4>Browserify</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://browserify.org/\\\">Browserify</a> is currently the prevailing CommonJS implementation. It is available as a CLI and a scriptable interface (say, inside node.js). This makes it easy to integrate into a build system such as gulp or to use on it’s own.</p>\\n<p>Browserify allows you to apply transforms during the build process for things like <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/reactify\\\">React</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/eugeneware/debowerify\\\">bower</a> and alt-js languages such as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/jnordberg/coffeeify\\\">CoffeeScript</a>.</p>\\n<h4>Webpack</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/\\\">Webpack</a> sees heavy usage in the React Community. Possibly due to Pete Hunt’s (and others’) <a href=\\\"https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto\\\">advocacy</a>. Webpack comes with nice things like Feature Flags and Multiple Entrypoints.</p>\\n<p>The most striking difference between Webpack and Browserify is the approach to building Components. Webpack takes a much more CSS-inclusive approach and can do dependency analysis if you’re using Multiple Entrypoints or similar. This approach to Components works very well with React’s concept of Components.</p>\\n<h3>Package Managers</h3>\\n<h4>NPM</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/\\\">NPM</a> is the defacto standard for node.js, but has also declared support for front-end dependency management. It can be hard to determine what packages are meant for the browser, server or both.</p>\\n<h4>Bower</h4>\\n<p>Bower is a front-end dependency management tool that is backed by Git/GitHub. Bower is also where <a href=\\\"https://leanpub.com/purescript/read\\\">PureScript</a>, an alt-js language, and some other tools make their packages available.</p>\\n<h4>Other</h4>\\n<p>There are also other, competing, managers at various levels such as <a href=\\\"http://volojs.org/\\\">Volo</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ender-js/Ender\\\">Ender</a></p>\\n<p>…but talking about Volo brings us into scaffolding tools…</p>\\n<h3>Scaffolding</h3>\\n<h4>Yeoman</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://yeoman.io/\\\">Yeoman</a> was originally a “Client Side Stack” but has transitioned to being a quite nice tool for scaffolding new projects. I suggest <a href=\\\"https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp\\\">this one</a> if you’re looking to learn more about Yeoman.</p>\\n<h4>Brunch</h4>\\n<p>I chose to include <a href=\\\"http://brunch.io/\\\">Brunch</a> here even though it also competes with Gulp/Grunt in that Brunch does Compilation, Minification, Concatenation and Watching of files. IMO Brunch tries to do too much in the world of JavaScript today. Specialized tools seem to be the current order.</p>\\n<h3>Build Systems</h3>\\n<h4>Grunt</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://gruntjs.com/\\\">Grunt</a> is a Task Runner for JavaScript. It works fairly well and has a plugin for almost anything you’ll need; I’ve also seen some pretty hairy grunt configs.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://gulpjs.com/\\\">Gulp</a> is “The New Order” of build systems. It is based on streaming so we can say goodbye to intermediate build files on disk. It also has a fairly expansive ecosystem of plugins that can be used. One interesting note is <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/vinyl-source-stream\\\">vinyl-source-streams</a>, which can be used to create streams out of tools like browserify.</p>\\n<h3>Utility Belts</h3>\\n<h4>Underscore</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://underscorejs.org/\\\">Underscore</a> was a default utility belt for awhile. It is a solid library that provides functional programming helpers and is:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The tie to go along with jQuery’s tux and Backbone’s suspenders.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h4>Lodash</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://lodash.com/\\\">Lodash</a> is “optimized underscore”. It is capable of being a drop-in replacement for underscore and provides <a href=\\\"http://lodash.com/#features\\\">some features</a> not available in underscore.</p>\\n<h4>Lazy.js</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/\\\">Lazy.js</a> can get even better performance than Lodash through Lazy Evaluation. It seems to be a logical step in the progression toward the new state of Front End JavaScript.</p>\\n<h3>Data Structures</h3>\\n<p>One very interesting trend to pop up is the release of Lazy and Immutable Data Structures for JavaScript. Often the assumption here is that what makes FE development difficult is the tracking of mutation and maintaining of State.</p>\\n<h4>Mori</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/swannodette/mori\\\">Mori</a> is Om/ClojureScript’s Lazy/Persistent/Immutable Data Structures intended for use in a JavaScript environment.</p>\\n<h4>ImmutableJS</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js\\\">ImmutableJS</a> is Facebook’s implementation of Immutable and Lazy Data Structures. It uses a JavaScript-First API and is designed with the context of React and Flux (being from Facebook).</p>\\n<h3>Front End Frameworks</h3>\\n<p>Finally, we come to “The Large List of Front End Frameworks”. There are a <em>ton</em> of them out there but I’m only going to cover a few of the most popular in an attempt to categorize different approaches.</p>\\n<h4>Angular: The Opinionated Approach</h4>\\n<p>Angular creates it’s own language in an effort to do a lot. Directives help developers create components and Services abstract data fetching. If you are a fan of Dependency Injection, Factories and Controllers, then you may do well to look at Angular.</p>\\n<h4>Backbone: The Dude Abides</h4>\\n<p>Backbone is fairly un-opinionated. <code>Models</code>/<code>Collection</code>, <code>Views</code> and <code>Routers</code> live here, which is fairly close to “MVC”. Backbone also includes an event system for listening to changes on Models/Collections or creating your own events.</p>\\n<p>Backbone’s flexibility has allowed (or required depending on your view) <a href=\\\"http://marionettejs.com/\\\">Marionette</a> to exist. It also means that you can replace any component as you wish. Want to use Handlebars? Mustache? no problem. Want to replace <code>Views</code> with React? no problem.</p>\\n<h4>React</h4>\\n<p>React is the new kid on the block and represents a substantial change in the way people think about building applications. With pure React, you would never manually adjust the DOM again. Instead allowing React’s implementation of a Virtual DOM to handle diffing and insertion of changes into the actual DOM.</p>\\n<p>React also represents a step toward Functional Programming concepts (<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function\\\">purity</a>, etc), which make React components easy to test and reason about. It also enables some more advanced concepts such as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/dustingetz/react-cursor\\\">Cursors</a> or <a href=\\\"http://lens.github.io/tutorial.html\\\">Lenses</a> which themselves enable a separation of data from View/DOM.</p>\\n<h4>Om</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/swannodette/om\\\">Om</a> is a special case of React. It is implemented in <a href=\\\"https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript\\\">ClojureScript</a>, uses some concepts such as <a href=\\\"http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011001_final_worlds.pdf\\\">Worlds</a> and Persistent Data Structures and has a fairly expansive ecosystem at this point.</p>\\n<p>There is a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/swannodette/om#applications-built-with-om\\\">list</a> of projects built with Om.</p>\\n<h3>The Types are Coming</h3>\\n<p>So where does this leave us?</p>\\n<p>Even if we leave out React/Om we can see a clear preference towards Functions as a first-class tool through libraries such as Underscore and Lodash. <em>With</em> React, we get to see where functional programming gets us, The testability of pure functions and the composition of Components (which are themselves functions). With Om, we see where more advanced Functional Programming techniques gets us: Performance from Persistent Data Structures and clarity through separation of IO with Worlds.</p>\\n<p>At this point it is interesting to note is that React was prototyped in SML and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/fbOpenSource/status/511643210482208768\\\">Flow</a> is implemented in <a href=\\\"https://ocaml.org/\\\">OCaml</a>. Flow promises to be “better” (note that not much is known about Flow publicly yet) than Microsoft’s <a href=\\\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/\\\">TypeScript</a>. We’ll have to wait to see how it compares to <a href=\\\"https://leanpub.com/purescript/read\\\">PureScript’s</a> Type System. (PureScript does have <a href=\\\"https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-react\\\">bindings to React</a> as well).</p>\\n<h1>Fin</h1>\\n<p>If I were a betting person, I would bet on the future being closer to a Purely Functional approach than I would on other approaches. What do you think?</p>\\n<p>In any case, The days where one could cobble together some HTML and call themselves a Front End Engineer are long gone and the future is very interesting.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 320 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Language Comparisons 0000001\",\"date\":\"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 15:53:51 +0000\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/2014/2/5/language-comparisons-0000001/\",\"body\":\"<p>In a thread on HN recently there was a prompt:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Read in a file full of numbers, one number on each line<br>\\nRepresent those numbers as integers in your program<br>\\nReplace each number with that number times its line number<br>\\nWrite the file out elsewhere<br>\\nAnd complete the task right now at your computer as fast as possible, you’re being timed</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Ignoring the spurious nature of the comment (and ignoring the benefits/drawbacks of interview-programming in general) there were a few responses:</p>\\n<p>Consider this file for the responses:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">3</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">4</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">5</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">6</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">8</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">9</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">10</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Python</h2>\\n<p>First, a sys-admin style Python script:</p>\\n<p>It considers lines to be 0-based.

From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./salty_egg.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Chinese Salty Egg\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2015-05-01-hello-world/index.md\n ** module id = 273\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"My Second Post!\",\"date\":\"2015-05-06T23:46:37.121Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/hi-folks/\",\"path\":\"/my-second-post/\",\"body\":\"<p>Wow!

Client side on mobile devices is a different story, with iOS using keychain for security and Android advocating OAuth-type approaches. As it happens, the task language doesn’t include the concept of users, just locations, so we’ll skip authentication to make it REST-Compliant (note: REST doesn’t have a spec.)</p>\\n<p>Attributes of a favorite location object include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>id</li>\\n<li>lat</li>\\n<li>lng</li>\\n<li>address (e.g. 800 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94114)</li>\\n<li>name (e.g. Work)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This could easily fit in a SQL database, but since we’re using Geolocation and I happen to know that MongoDB’s Geo facilities would allow us to query based on distance from our current position, we’ll use Mongo. Alternatively, we could have also used ElasticSearch/Solr/Lucene but Mongo will serve our purposes just fine.</p>\\n<p>We will be deploying on Heroku to use the free ssl support and addons.

2014\",\"date\":\"Wed, 08 Jan 2014 03:00:20 +0000\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/2014/1/7/books-on-my-bookshelf-for-2014/\",\"body\":\"<p>I decided to take stock of the books that are sitting on my bookshelf for 2014. Here is that list.</p>\\n<p>Starting with some (of my) classics. These are books that I read in the middle/high school time period in my life.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Technical-Mathematics-Calculus-Edition/dp/0133116530?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Basic Technical Mathematics with Calculus</a></h4>\\n<p>(note: my version is the second edition. It looks like they’re up to the tenth)</p>\\n<p>This was a book that let me explore math on my own. It goes from trig functions through linear equations, logarithms, determinants and matrices, derivatives, integration, series expansion and differential equations. A little beyond what my AP Calc class ended up taking us through. I would suggest it if you have an interest in Mathematics and Calculus at an advanced high school level.</p>\\n<h4>Texas Instruments TI-83+ Manual</h4>\\n<p>I read this cover to cover one day. It led through the days of BASIC on a calculator in Math class, where I would program equation solvers and games.</p>\\n<h2>Distributed Systems</h2>\\n<h4>Distributed Systems Concepts and Design</h4>\\n<p>The purchase of this book was driven by my interest in Erlang and Riak Core. I was hoping that this would give me some good information on distributed systems but it’s a bit of a slog to parse the wordiness of the book. Preferable would be to surf the repos of various open source projects. The table of contents, however, is useful in pointing you to on the path to those projects.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Concurrent-Programming-Haskell-Multithreaded/dp/1449335942/?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell</a></h4>\\n<p>A solid book that takes you through parallelism and concurrency in Haskell with plenty of code to work with. Concepts covered include Data Parallel Programing, GPU programming, MVars, Software Transactional Memory and finally distributed-process, which is an attempt to create a sort of Erlang-as-a-package for Haskell.</p>\\n<h2>Databases</h2>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Readings-Database-Systems-Joseph-Hellerstein/dp/0262693143?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Readings in Database Systems</a></h4>\\n<p>Databases are not my specialty, so I use this book as some casual reading. It is a collection of academic papers relating to databases.</p>\\n<h2>Lisp, Lambda Calculus and Functional Programming</h2>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831?tag=christophe067-20\\\">An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus</a></h4>\\n<p>This is a fun book that take you through the lambda calculus with a functional slant. Includes some comparisons with Lisp and Scheme later in the book.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Pearls-Functional-Algorithm-Design-Richard/dp/0521513383?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design</a></h4>\\n<p>A nice look at functional algorithms with plenty of Haskell code. I quite enjoy this book when I’m in an algorithmic mood.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/\\\">Common Lisp</a></h4>\\n<p>Widely recognized as a great introduction to the Common Lisp language. I don’t write as much Lisp as I would like to, but having mocl around for experimentation sure helps.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://letoverlambda.com/\\\">Let Over Lambda</a></h4>\\n<p>Let Over Lambda is billed as a book about macros, in other words a book to move you from intermediate lisper to professional. I’d like to spend a little more time with Common Lisp over the next year and Let Over Lambda will be one of the books I use to do that.</p>\\n<h2>Training</h2>\\n<p>For those that don’t know, I train for Volleyball and High Jump. Having played Division 1 Volleyball in college I still enjoy training and competing at a high level. These books help me move towards my athletic goals.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Weightlifting-Programming-Winning-Coachs-Guide/dp/0980011159?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Weightlifting Programming: A Winning Coach’s Guide</a></h4>\\n<p>This is a book by a well respected coach in the weightlifting community. Since I use Olympic lifts in my training this will help me program my lifting workouts for greater effect.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/1467933120?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Overcoming Gravity</a></h4>\\n<p>I’m not a huge fan of doing bench press, bicep curls, etc. So I got this book about training gymnastics movements to supplement my Olympic lifting, especially my upper body which I don’t need excess hypertrophy on.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Abs-Ball-Approach-Building-Abdominals/dp/089281098X?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Abs on the Ball: A Pilates Approach to Building Superb Abdominals</a></h4>\\n<p>In the past I’ve found Pilates on exercise balls to be a great way to improve core strength and stability. Colleen Craig’s books have been on my shelf for awhile and I often take exercises from them. Core strength will help me in my lifts, gymnastics training and controlling my body in the air while jumping for High Jump and Volleyball.</p>\\n<h4><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Supple-Leopard-Preventing-Performance/dp/1936608588?tag=christophe067-20\\\">Becoming a Supple Leopard: The Ultimate Guide to Resolving Pain, Preventing Injury, and Optimizing Athletic Performance</a></h4>\\n<p>This is a book I use for preventative maintenance of joints and muscles.

In this post we’ll go over building a simple Dockerfile to deploy the project.</p>\\n<p>Make sure you’ve <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation\\\">installed docker</a></p>\\n<h2>Building the Haskell Base</h2>\\n<p>There is an effort to make a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/darinmorrison/docker-haskell/tree/docker-library\\\">docker official haskell image</a> so we’ll use that. Once it’s merged into <code>docker-library</code>, we can simply skip building the <code>docker-haskell</code> from scratch.</p>\\n<p>Clone docker-haskell and switch to the docker-library branch. (It doesn’t matter where on the computer we do this)</p>\\n<pre><code>git clone git@github<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\">.com</span>:darinmorrison/docker-haskell<span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\">.git</span>\\ncd docker-haskell\\ngit checkout docker-library\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Once in the appropriate directory, we can build the image with <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build\\\"><code>docker build</code></a>. <code>-t</code> is short for <code>--tag</code>, which lets us tag an image. We’ll use <code>haskell</code> for the base name and tag it as <code>7.8</code>. Finally, the <code>.</code> tells docker where to find the dockerfile we’re building.</p>\\n<pre><code>cd <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7.8</span>\\ndocker build -t haskell:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7.8</span> .\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We can test that it worked by using <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#run\\\"><code>docker run</code></a> to spawn <code>ghci</code> as an interactive pseudo-tty.</p>\\n<pre><code>docker run -<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">i</span> -t haskell:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7.8</span> ghci\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Use <code>:q</code> to quit <code>ghci</code> as usual.</p>\\n<h1>Building our Project</h1>\\n<p>We’ll base our project on the docker image we just built.</p>\\n<p>NOTE: We can push this base image <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerrepos/#pushing-a-repository-to-docker-hub\\\">to the docker hub</a> but interestingly enough, we don’t have to (if we’re using “normal” repos; Automated Builds are a different story). We can push the final image without pushing the base image.</p>\\n<h3>Dockerfile</h3>\\n<p>Our <code>Dockerfile</code> goes in the root of the <code>auth-server/</code> folder. If you’ve built a haskell project before and are familiar with cabal sandboxes, this will be similar:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># https://github.com/darinmorrison/docker-haskell/tree/docker-library</span>\\nFROM haskell:7.8\\n\\nRUN cabal update\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Add Cabal File and deps/ folder</span>\\nADD ./auth-server.cabal /opt/auth-server/auth-server.cabal\\nADD ./deps /opt/auth-server/deps\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Create Sandbox and Add Source Deps</span>\\nRUN cd /opt/auth-server &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox init &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/io-streams-haproxy &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/snap &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/snap-core &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/snap-server &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/snap-loader-static &amp;&amp;\\n        cabal sandbox<span class=\\\"hljs-instruction\\\"> add-source </span>deps/heist\\n\\nRUN cd /opt/auth-server &amp;&amp;

This is because I inserted data twice into Riak without using a VClock the second time (While I was writing this post), resulting in siblings. This issue is easily resolvable by resolving the siblings as mentioned <a href=\\\"http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/theory/concepts/Vector-Clocks/\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Now, we can convert to miles by multiplying the score (which is degrees) by <code>69.09341</code>. If we do this for San Jose it would be <code>.2221485 * 69.09341</code>, or about <code>15.34 mi</code>.</p>\\n<p>For Kilometers we use <code>111.1951</code>, which gives us about <code>24.7 km</code>.</p>\\n<p>Since our query location was from Palo Alto, California, we can see that San Jose is indeed, approximately that 15 miles away. Our search was successful!</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./old-wordpress-posts/geospatial-indexing-with-riak-search-2-0-yokozunasolr.md\n ** module id = 308\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Getting Started with PureScript\",\"date\":\"Sun, 22 Jun 2014 18:48:27 +0000\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/2014/6/22/getting-started-with-purescript/\",\"body\":\"<p>According to <a href=\\\"http://www.purescript.org/\\\" title=\\\"purescript.org\\\">PureScript.org</a></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>PureScript is a small strongly, statically typed programming language with expressive types, written in and inspired by Haskell, and compiling to Javascript.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It’s fairly easy to get started with the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/purescript-contrib/grunt-init-purescript\\\" title=\\\"grunt init purescript template\\\">grunt-init-purescript template</a></p>\\n<h2>Dependencies</h2>\\n<p>We will need <a href=\\\"http://gruntjs.com/\\\">grunt</a>,<a href=\\\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init\\\">grunt-init</a> and <a href=\\\"http://bower.io/\\\">bower</a> to work with this PureScript template. <a href=\\\"http://nodejs.org/\\\" title=\\\"nodejs\\\">Node</a> is also a dependency because of this.</p>\\n<p><code>&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;overflow-x:auto&quot;&gt;npm install -g grunt grunt-init bower</code></p>\\n<p>Then clone the template into a <code>.grunt-init</code> folder using git:</p>\\n<pre><code>&lt;code class=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"bash\\\"</span> style=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"overflow-x:auto\\\"</span>&gt;mkdir ~/.grunt-init\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-label\\\">git clone https:</span>//github.com/purescript-contrib/grunt-init-purescript.git ~/.grunt-init/purescript<span class=\\\"hljs-escape\\\">``</span><span class=\\\"hljs-escape\\\">`\\n</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-label\\\">We also need the PureScript compiler, which we can grab with cabal:</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-escape\\\">`&lt;</span>code class=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"bash\\\"</span> style=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"overflow-x:auto\\\"</span>&gt;cabal install purescript<span class=\\\"hljs-escape\\\">`\\n</span>\\n\\n## Developing\\n\\nWe can now install dependencies from npm <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">and</span> bower.

We’ve defined <code>Params</code> as a <code>newtype</code> for a <code>Data.Map</code> because, making an educated guess, the keys for params won’t always be the same. We can reach this conclusion by seeing that one of the keys is an IP address (with a port number).</p>\\n<p>Another interesting piece of the response is the <code>Docs</code>. Solr seems to return the id in Solr (<code>_yz</code> is presumably for _yokozuna), the Riak Key (<code>_yz_rk</code>), the Riak Bucket Type <code>_yz_rt</code> and the Riak Bucket (<code>_yz_rb</code>). This is useful information because we will need to use riak-haskell-client (or more likely an updated fork for Riak 2.0) to retrieve the actual data.</p>\\n<p>We can now write some JSON instances and basic http code to test.

If you don’t stop and look around for a while, you could miss it.” – Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>The State of Front End Development</h3>\\n<p>Front End tools are moving fast these days. Let’s take a minute to (briefly) look at where we’re going.</p>\\n<h3>Module Systems</h3>\\n<h3>The Old Way</h3>\\n<p>From a user-facing view, the old way is to wrap code in closures.</p>\\n<pre><code>(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.myGlobal = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{};\\n}());\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>AMD</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html\\\">Why AMD?</a> is covered in other areas but suffice it to say it looks like the below and is being superseded by the ubiquity and conciseness of CommonJS.</p>\\n<pre><code>define([<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'jquery'</span>] , <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">($)</span> </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{};\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>CommonJS</h4>\\n<p>CommonJS is used in node.js which likely contributed to its rise. It is also fairly simple to read and understand. There isn’t as much boilerplate as AMD (where the define/arguments are position-sensitive and can get fairly long).</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// hello.js</span>\\nexports.hello = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Hello World'</span>\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// main.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> example = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./hello.js'</span>);\\nexample.hello();\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>ES6</h4>\\n<p>ES6 modules are usable via transpilers, in some cases <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-modules-commonjs\\\">compiling to CommonJS</a></p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span> React from <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react\\\"</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> {format} <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"util\\\"</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">export</span> {React, format <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">as</span> fmt};\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>PureScript</h4>\\n<p>PureScript <a href=\\\"http://docs.purescript.org/en/latest/modules.html\\\">modules</a> can compile to CommonJS modules.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-module\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">module</span> A <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">where</span></span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">id</span> x = x\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Implementations of Module Systems</h3>\\n<h4>RequireJS</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://requirejs.org/\\\">RequireJS</a> is an implementation of AMD. It comes with an optimizer (r.js) but many people have since moved on to CommonJS tools such as Browserify.</p>\\n<h4>Browserify</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://browserify.org/\\\">Browserify</a> is currently the prevailing CommonJS implementation. It is available as a CLI and a scriptable interface (say, inside node.js). This makes it easy to integrate into a build system such as gulp or to use on it’s own.</p>\\n<p>Browserify allows you to apply transforms during the build process for things like <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/reactify\\\">React</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/eugeneware/debowerify\\\">bower</a> and alt-js languages such as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/jnordberg/coffeeify\\\">CoffeeScript</a>.</p>\\n<h4>Webpack</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/\\\">Webpack</a> sees heavy usage in the React Community. Possibly due to Pete Hunt’s (and others’) <a href=\\\"https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto\\\">advocacy</a>. Webpack comes with nice things like Feature Flags and Multiple Entrypoints.</p>\\n<p>The most striking difference between Webpack and Browserify is the approach to building Components. Webpack takes a much more CSS-inclusive approach and can do dependency analysis if you’re using Multiple Entrypoints or similar. This approach to Components works very well with React’s concept of Components.</p>\\n<h3>Package Managers</h3>\\n<h4>NPM</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/\\\">NPM</a> is the defacto standard for node.js, but has also declared support for front-end dependency management. It can be hard to determine what packages are meant for the browser, server or both.</p>\\n<h4>Bower</h4>\\n<p>Bower is a front-end dependency management tool that is backed by Git/GitHub. Bower is also where <a href=\\\"https://leanpub.com/purescript/read\\\">PureScript</a>, an alt-js language, and some other tools make their packages available.</p>\\n<h4>Other</h4>\\n<p>There are also other, competing, managers at various levels such as <a href=\\\"http://volojs.org/\\\">Volo</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ender-js/Ender\\\">Ender</a></p>\\n<p>…but talking about Volo brings us into scaffolding tools…</p>\\n<h3>Scaffolding</h3>\\n<h4>Yeoman</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://yeoman.io/\\\">Yeoman</a> was originally a “Client Side Stack” but has transitioned to being a quite nice tool for scaffolding new projects. I suggest <a href=\\\"https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp\\\">this one</a> if you’re looking to learn more about Yeoman.</p>\\n<h4>Brunch</h4>\\n<p>I chose to include <a href=\\\"http://brunch.io/\\\">Brunch</a> here even though it also competes with Gulp/Grunt in that Brunch does Compilation, Minification, Concatenation and Watching of files. IMO Brunch tries to do too much in the world of JavaScript today. Specialized tools seem to be the current order.</p>\\n<h3>Build Systems</h3>\\n<h4>Grunt</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://gruntjs.com/\\\">Grunt</a> is a Task Runner for JavaScript. It works fairly well and has a plugin for almost anything you’ll need; I’ve also seen some pretty hairy grunt configs.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://gulpjs.com/\\\">Gulp</a> is “The New Order” of build systems. It is based on streaming so we can say goodbye to intermediate build files on disk. It also has a fairly expansive ecosystem of plugins that can be used. One interesting note is <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/vinyl-source-stream\\\">vinyl-source-streams</a>, which can be used to create streams out of tools like browserify.</p>\\n<h3>Utility Belts</h3>\\n<h4>Underscore</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://underscorejs.org/\\\">Underscore</a> was a default utility belt for awhile. It is a solid library that provides functional programming helpers and is:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The tie to go along with jQuery’s tux and Backbone’s suspenders.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h4>Lodash</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://lodash.com/\\\">Lodash</a> is “optimized underscore”. It is capable of being a drop-in replacement for underscore and provides <a href=\\\"http://lodash.com/#features\\\">some features</a> not available in underscore.</p>\\n<h4>Lazy.js</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/\\\">Lazy.js</a> can get even better performance than Lodash through Lazy Evaluation. It seems to be a logical step in the progression toward the new state of Front End JavaScript.</p>\\n<h3>Data Structures</h3>\\n<p>One very interesting trend to pop up is the release of Lazy and Immutable Data Structures for JavaScript. Often the assumption here is that what makes FE development difficult is the tracking of mutation and maintaining of State.</p>\\n<h4>Mori</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/swannodette/mori\\\">Mori</a> is Om/ClojureScript’s Lazy/Persistent/Immutable Data Structures intended for use in a JavaScript environment.</p>\\n<h4>ImmutableJS</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js\\\">ImmutableJS</a> is Facebook’s implementation of Immutable and Lazy Data Structures. It uses a JavaScript-First API and is designed with the context of React and Flux (being from Facebook).</p>\\n<h3>Front End Frameworks</h3>\\n<p>Finally, we come to “The Large List of Front End Frameworks”. There are a <em>ton</em> of them out there but I’m only going to cover a few of the most popular in an attempt to categorize different approaches.</p>\\n<h4>Angular: The Opinionated Approach</h4>\\n<p>Angular creates it’s own language in an effort to do a lot. Directives help developers create components and Services abstract data fetching. If you are a fan of Dependency Injection, Factories and Controllers, then you may do well to look at Angular.</p>\\n<h4>Backbone: The Dude Abides</h4>\\n<p>Backbone is fairly un-opinionated. <code>Models</code>/<code>Collection</code>, <code>Views</code> and <code>Routers</code> live here, which is fairly close to “MVC”. Backbone also includes an event system for listening to changes on Models/Collections or creating your own events.</p>\\n<p>Backbone’s flexibility has allowed (or required depending on your view) <a href=\\\"http://marionettejs.com/\\\">Marionette</a> to exist. It also means that you can replace any component as you wish. Want to use Handlebars? Mustache? no problem. Want to replace <code>Views</code> with React? no problem.</p>\\n<h4>React</h4>\\n<p>React is the new kid on the block and represents a substantial change in the way people think about building applications. With pure React, you would never manually adjust the DOM again. Instead allowing React’s implementation of a Virtual DOM to handle diffing and insertion of changes into the actual DOM.</p>\\n<p>React also represents a step toward Functional Programming concepts (<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function\\\">purity</a>, etc), which make React components easy to test and reason about. It also enables some more advanced concepts such as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/dustingetz/react-cursor\\\">Cursors</a> or <a href=\\\"http://lens.github.io/tutorial.html\\\">Lenses</a> which themselves enable a separation of data from View/DOM.</p>\\n<h4>Om</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/swannodette/om\\\">Om</a> is a special case of React. It is implemented in <a href=\\\"https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript\\\">ClojureScript</a>, uses some concepts such as <a href=\\\"http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011001_final_worlds.pdf\\\">Worlds</a> and Persistent Data Structures and has a fairly expansive ecosystem at this point.</p>\\n<p>There is a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/swannodette/om#applications-built-with-om\\\">list</a> of projects built with Om.</p>\\n<h3>The Types are Coming</h3>\\n<p>So where does this leave us?</p>\\n<p>Even if we leave out React/Om we can see a clear preference towards Functions as a first-class tool through libraries such as Underscore and Lodash. <em>With</em> React, we get to see where functional programming gets us, The testability of pure functions and the composition of Components (which are themselves functions). With Om, we see where more advanced Functional Programming techniques gets us: Performance from Persistent Data Structures and clarity through separation of IO with Worlds.</p>\\n<p>At this point it is interesting to note is that React was prototyped in SML and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/fbOpenSource/status/511643210482208768\\\">Flow</a> is implemented in <a href=\\\"https://ocaml.org/\\\">OCaml</a>. Flow promises to be “better” (note that not much is known about Flow publicly yet) than Microsoft’s <a href=\\\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/\\\">TypeScript</a>. We’ll have to wait to see how it compares to <a href=\\\"https://leanpub.com/purescript/read\\\">PureScript’s</a> Type System. (PureScript does have <a href=\\\"https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-react\\\">bindings to React</a> as well).</p>\\n<h1>Fin</h1>\\n<p>If I were a betting person, I would bet on the future being closer to a Purely Functional approach than I would on other approaches. What do you think?</p>\\n<p>In any case, The days where one could cobble together some HTML and call themselves a Front End Engineer are long gone and the future is very interesting.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./old-wordpress-posts/it-is-no-longer-enough-to-know-html.md\n ** module id = 319\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Language Comparisons 0000001\",\"date\":\"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 15:53:51 +0000\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/2014/2/5/language-comparisons-0000001/\",\"body\":\"<p>In a thread on HN recently there was a prompt:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Read in a file full of numbers, one number on each line<br>\\nRepresent those numbers as integers in your program<br>\\nReplace each number with that number times its line number<br>\\nWrite the file out elsewhere<br>\\nAnd complete the task right now at your computer as fast as possible, you’re being timed</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Ignoring the spurious nature of the comment (and ignoring the benefits/drawbacks of interview-programming in general) there were a few responses:</p>\\n<p>Consider this file for the responses:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">3</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">4</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">5</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">6</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">8</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">9</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">10</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Python</h2>\\n<p>First, a sys-admin style Python script:</p>\\n<p>It considers lines to be 0-based.
