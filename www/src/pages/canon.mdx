## Consulting and Business

- F\*ck You. Pay Me.

  - Things change. When they do you want a contract in place
    to formalize the relationship. This is true even when
    the consulting/client relationship is really good.
  - "Stop being bottoms" is a problematic way to phrase it,
    but the intent behind what he's saying is true. Which is
    that people should stop voluntarily giving up the power
    they have in the professional relationship.
  - Don't blindly accept terms. _you can strike terms from
    contracts you accept_. This includes consulting
    contracts _and_ employment contracts.
  - Kill fees
    - If a contract gets killed without good reason, you get
      paid for some segment
    - If you are not comfortable with what a client is
      asking you to do _walk away_.
  - If you aren't getting paid on time, walk away
