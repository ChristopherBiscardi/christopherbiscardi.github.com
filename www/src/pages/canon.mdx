## Consulting and Business

### F\*ck You. Pay Me.

- Things change. When they do you want a contract in place
  to formalize the relationship. This is true even when the
  consulting/client relationship is really good.
- "Stop being bottoms" is a problematic way to phrase it,
  but the intent behind what he's saying is true. Which is
  that people should stop voluntarily giving up the power
  they have in the professional relationship.
- Don't blindly accept terms. _you can strike terms from
  contracts you accept_. This includes consulting contracts
  _and_ employment contracts.
- Kill fees
  - If a contract gets killed without good reason, you get
    paid for some segment
  - If you are not comfortable with what a client is asking
    you to do _walk away_.
- If you aren't getting paid on time, walk away

## Programming

### JavaScript

- [Io](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(programming_language)>)
  had a large influence on my JS knowledge.
- Specifically the section on it in
  [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X)
  got me started
- This quote specifically was the most important piece of
  knowledge I gained about JS I think
