How can we construct a GraphQL interface such that we can source data from multiple locations? Check out the livestream here:

The old way (that still works) but is really low level and complicated is [found here:](
https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/christopherbiscardi.github.com/blob/24227770908405592bb916938944579ba50b43c5/www/gatsby-node.js)

So the first thing we need is an interface, conceptually and literally. For this post we’ll keep it small and use an interface with a title and a body. Note that there are two additional features that are required for what we’re doing with Gatsby: `@nodeInterface` and the `id` field, which is required for satisfying the Gatsby `Node` interface.

```graphql
interface BlogPost @nodeInterface {
      id: ID!
      title: String
      body: String!
}`
```

This interface allows us to construct types that satisfy the interface which effectively means we are backing `BlogPost` with custom types. Being an interface means we can have multiple custom types that back the interface at the same time. So when we query `allBlogPost`, were really querying the collection of custom types that satisfy the interface.

## Querying for Yaml

We'll start with something that uses the GraphQL SDL, using a Yaml node to satisfy the interface. Since [`gatsby-transformer-yaml`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-yaml) names it's type after the directory name, we end up with a Yaml node that is of type `ContentYaml`. We can use the `createTypes` schema customization API to change the types that the fields resolve to by using the same name. Importantly, we specify that this type implements `Node` *and* `BlogPost`, as this will allow us to query the content through the interface. Here's the content of our yaml file:

```yaml
subject: Some title
body: Some body content for the blog post
```

and the type we use to override it. Note that we're proxying the `subject` field to the `title` field to comply with the `BlogPost` interface.

```js
createTypes(`type ContentYaml implements Node & BlogPost {
    id: ID!
    title: String @proxy(from: "subject")
    body: String!
}`);
```

And now we can query the Yaml content through `allBlogPost`.

## Querying for Mdx

Querying for Mdx takes a bit more work. We have to solve an additional problem because some of the content (like `body` or `excerpt`) is only returned by resolvers and doesn't exist on the node itself. To achieve this, we'll take a subset of `Mdx` nodes and turn them into a new node time: `MdxBlogPost`. This new node type will be the type that implements our `BlogPost` interface. Here's the type definition for our new node. We use `buildObjectType` as that lets us pass resolvers through to the parent type (`Mdx` in this case).

```js
createTypes(
  schema.buildObjectType({
    name: `MdxBlogPost`,
    fields: {
      id: { type: `ID!` },
      title: {
        type: "String!"
      },
      body: {
        type: "String!",
        resolve(source, args, context, info) {
          const type = info.schema.getType(`Mdx`);
          const mdxNode = context.nodeModel.getNodeById({
            id: source.parent
          });
          const resolver = type.getFields()["body"].resolve;
          return resolver(mdxNode, {}, context, {
            fieldName: "body"
          });
        }
      }
    },
    interfaces: [`Node`, `BlogPost`]
  })
);
```

Then we need to select the subset of `Mdx` nodes to turn into the new node type and create the new nodes.

```js
exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode, createNodeId }) => {
  const { createNodeField, createNode, createParentChildLink } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === `Mdx`) {
    const { frontmatter } = node;
    const parent = getNode(node.parent);

    if (parent.sourceInstanceName === "posts") {
      const fieldData = {
        title: node.frontmatter.title
      };

      createNode({
        ...fieldData,
        // Required fields.
        id: createNodeId(`${node.id} >>> MdxBlogPost`),
        parent: node.id,
        children: [],
        internal: {
          type: `MdxBlogPost`,
          contentDigest: crypto
            .createHash(`md5`)
            .update(JSON.stringify(fieldData))
            .digest(`hex`),
          content: JSON.stringify(fieldData),
          description: `Satisfies the BlogPost interface for Mdx`
        }
      });
      createParentChildLink({ parent: parent, child: node });
    }
  }
};
```

That's it. We now have two types that implement the `BlogPost` interface that we can query at the same time through the interface. This sets the stage for a number of really cool opportunities such as sourcing `BlogPost` content from arbitrary sources, like different CMSs.

Check out the full `gatsby-node.js` file here:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");
const fs = require("fs");
exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions, schema }) => {
  const { createTypes } = actions;

  createTypes(`interface BlogPost @nodeInterface {
      id: ID!
      title: String
      body: String!
  }`);

  createTypes(`type ContentYaml implements Node & BlogPost {
      id: ID!
      title: String @proxy(from: "subject")
      body: String!
  }`);

  createTypes(
    schema.buildObjectType({
      name: `MdxBlogPost`,
      fields: {
        id: { type: `ID!` },
        title: {
          type: "String!"
        },
        body: {
          type: "String!",
          resolve(source, args, context, info) {
            const type = info.schema.getType(`Mdx`);
            const mdxNode = context.nodeModel.getNodeById({
              id: source.parent
            });
            const resolver = type.getFields()["body"].resolve;
            return resolver(mdxNode, {}, context, {
              fieldName: "body"
            });
          }
        }
      },
      interfaces: [`Node`, `BlogPost`]
    })
  );
};

exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode, createNodeId }) => {
  const { createNodeField, createNode, createParentChildLink } = actions;

  if (node.internal.type === `Mdx`) {
    const { frontmatter } = node;
    const parent = getNode(node.parent);

    if (parent.sourceInstanceName === "posts") {
      const fieldData = {
        title: node.frontmatter.title
      };

      createNode({
        ...fieldData,
        // Required fields.
        id: createNodeId(`${node.id} >>> MdxBlogPost`),
        parent: node.id,
        children: [],
        internal: {
          type: `MdxBlogPost`,
          contentDigest: crypto
            .createHash(`md5`)
            .update(JSON.stringify(fieldData))
            .digest(`hex`),
          content: JSON.stringify(fieldData),
          description: `Satisfies the BlogPost interface for Mdx`
        }
      });
      createParentChildLink({ parent: parent, child: node });
    }
  }
};
```
