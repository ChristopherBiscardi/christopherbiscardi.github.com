```bash
brew update
brew install ivy
git clone -b rz-yokozuna-2 git://github.com/basho/riak.git
cd riak
make yz-setup
```

It’s important to have Ivy installed before `make yz-setup` or the priv/solr.jar
won’t be built. The build script only checks for the containing folder, not the
built .jar so you’ll have to either re-clone the git repo or remove the entire
solr folder after installing Ivy.
