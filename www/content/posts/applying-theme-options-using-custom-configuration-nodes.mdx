  Applying theme options using custom configuration nodes

Building large Gatsby themes can result in a large array of
configuration options to manage as a theme author. We can
also find ourselves wanting the ability to let other themes
or users' sites to add additional configuration instances
(ex: get more blog posts from this folder and process them
as usual).

Let's take a look at an example of this pattern. First, set
up our configuration node type in the Gatsby system using
`createSchemaCustomization`.

```js title=gatsby-node.js
exports.createSchemaCustomization = (
  { actions },
) => {
  const { createTypes } = actions
  createTypes(`type NotesConfig implements Node {
basePath: String!
homeText: String
breadcrumbSeparator: String
}`)
```

Then in `sourceNodes` we'll talk the options configured with
defaults and inject them into the node system as a node.

```js title=gatsby-node.js
var crypto = require("crypto");

exports.sourceNodes = (
  { actions: { createNode }, schema },
  {
    basePath = `/`,
    homeText = `~`,
    breadcrumbSeparator = `/`
  }
) => {
  // create garden data from plugin config
  const notesConfig = {
    breadcrumbSeparator,
    basePath,
    homeText
  };

  createNode({
    ...notesConfig,
    id: `gatsby-theme-notes-config`,
    parent: null,
    children: [],
    internal: {
      type: `NotesConfig`,
      contentDigest: crypto
        .createHash(`md5`)
        .update(JSON.stringify(notesConfig))
        .digest(`hex`),
      content: JSON.stringify(notesConfig),
      description: `Notes Config`
    }
  });
};
```

Because we've specified a specific ID, and because of
Gatsby's implementation of node ownership, our theme
effectively owns this object and we can be confident it
hasn't been modified. Using `useStaticQuery` we can now
access this data inside our components anywhere in our
application.

```js
import React from "react";
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby";
export default () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query NotesConfigObjectQuery {
      nodesConfig(id: { eq: "gatsby-theme-notes-config" }) {
        homeText
        breadcrumbSeparator
      }
    }
  `);
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>{data.notesConfig.homeText}</h1>
    </header>
  );
};
```

## Combining Nodes

If we had some field that semantically could be included
multiple times, we could skip the specific ID and query
`allNotesConfig` with our own merge algorithm. Let's take a
look at a hypothetical `someOption` field that is typed as
such:

```graphql
type someOption = [String!]!
```

Querying this gives us a set of nested arrays.

```js
import React from "react";
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby";
export default () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query NotesConfigObjectQuery {
      allNotesConfig {
        nodes {
          someOption
        }
      }
    }
  `);
  return (
    <header>
      <ul>
        {data.allNotesConfig.nodes
          .map(({ someOption }) => someOption)
          .flat()
          .map(item => (
            <li>{item}</li>
          ))}
      </ul>
    </header>
  );
};
```
