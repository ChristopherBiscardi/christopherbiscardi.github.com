I was writing a quick script today and came across a nice use case for .apply to
merge nested arrays into a single array. So I figured I’d share it.

```javascript
    //If we have nested arrays of depth = 1:
    var arr = [[1,2,3],[4,5],6];
    //we can flatten it by using concat and apply
    var flat_arr = [].concat.apply([],arr);
    //and check the value
    console.log(flat_arr);
    //logs [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

If you need a recursive (ie: infinitely nested) array flattened, check out the
source for Underscore’s [flatten()](http://underscorejs.org/#flatten) function,
which uses concat.apply for shallow arrays.
