Recently I started completely scheduling out every weekday from waking
up to going to bed, which I'm calling "Hard Scheduling". This approach
is a bit off the beaten path but with my recent move to a consulting
lifestyle, I can schedule appropriate time for clients, recharging,
and personal improvement.

## Blocking out the Day

I have a few repeating events that change as little as possible. These
events effectively scaffold the outer boundaries of my day. My day
starts at 4am with about an hour to wake up, eat breakfast and start
traveling to a gym, where I allocate a two hour block to working out
and traveling back home. I then spend one hour writing (and not
necessarily publishing) on any topic I feel like.

The other end of my day is where I've allocated an hour to reading and
an hour to falling asleep after reading. Reading before bed is done on
hardcovers and paperbacks so I'm not staring into a screen. This makes
it easier for me to get to sleep at the appropriate time since reading
is a solid wind-down activity.

## Types of Blocks

I have a few recurring blocks of time, typically scheduled at an hour
a piece and sometimes for two hours. The blocks can be rearranged or
replaced (because life happens) but the goal is to set them up each
week and not alter most of them.

### Client/Product Work

The first is client work and product work. Scheduling Client/Product
work allows me to ensure I keep my commitments each week. I've found
that certain types of work, such as engineering inside a complicated
codebase, require more than an hours effort at a time. Most, however,
can be scheduled into hour-long chunks.

I also include working on my own product in this type of
allocation. Since I try to keep at least an hour for my own products
each day this helps keep forward momentum, which is the most important
thing in my opinion.

### Social

I meet up with friends to help them with their products, grab coffee,
or just hang out. This all falls under a Social allocation for
me. Sometimes repeating social engagements turn into work, which then
gets allocated under Client/Product work.

### Down Time

I also schedule pure down time, for which nothing productive is
done. This allows me to refresh and reset for any work that needs to
happen later that day. Down Time allocation can be as simple as going
alone to a specific lunch spot to try new food or playing a video
game.

### Professional/Personal Development

Professional development includes learning new languages (Rust, Go),
new tools, reading blog posts (startups, building culture, etc), and
more. Anything that sets me up to be successful 6-12 months from
now in a variety of skillsets (Engineer, Entrepreneur, Author,
Designer, etc). This answers "What do I want to be" in the 6-12 month
range.

Personal development is similar but more introspective. It can
include time for meditation or actively integrating content from a
book I just read into my life. Answering the question "Who do I want
to be" on a 6-12 month timeframe.

Both of these tie in with a GitHub board I use to track my goals on a
6-12 month basis.

### Gym Routine

I specifically allocated a two hour block for the gym because I prefer
to focus on Olympic style lifting (mostly [cleans][cleans] and squat
right now) and it can take up a full hour to get through two or three
big exercises. I can't jerk or snatch right now because the ceiling is
too low. I taught myself how to lift this way in high school for
Volleyball and continued through college. I also have to allocate
travel time. I usually end up spending 1.5 hours at and traveling back
from the gym so this leaves a little room for growth for accessory
style work or alternative workouts. I also intend to schedule
recurring running and yoga blocks but haven't figured out where they
fit yet.

I've found that this kind of very heavy lifting is extremely good for
my mental state, so I'm happy to allocate the time here.

### Reading/Writing

I allocate writing time in the morning and reading time at night. This
accounts for about two hours each weekday.

### Maintenance

Finally, I also schedule maintenance such as "Make Instacart Order",
"Get Haircut", etc.

## Realizations

* This schedule is compatible with a GitHub board which I use for long
  term goal tracking. With the complete scheduling I can make sure I
  allocate time to progress in areas that mean a lot to me.
* I feel more productive. More things get done and I can get lost in
  each before moving on to the next.
* Overall I find it useful to be putting more thought into how I'm
  allocating my time, what I'm spending that time on, and how that
  differs from my goals.

### Social and Other People's Schedules

A decent amount of social engagements happen at night, starting at 6pm
or later. If I move my sleep back at night, then I move my wakeup time
back in the morning (because losing sleep is a non-option in terms of
long-term tradeoffs). This means I'm choosing between working out in
the morning and social time in a number of situations. I often choose
social time in this tradeoff because I'm not currently training for
high level athletics like I used to and time with friends is highly
valuable.

### Conscious Adjustment

One of the interesting outcomes of scheduling all of this time is that
I can make conscious decisions about when and how to re-allocate
time. If a friend wants to meet up earlier in the day I can move
blocks around and still make sure I get everything I want to
done. Another interesting note is the ability to consciously
prioritize one activity over another by deleting the calendar event
and making a new one. The newfound awareness of where I'm spending my
time is something I will continue to think about as this goes on.
