Many blogging platforms have the concept of shortcodes. This is especially prevalent in the [WordPress community](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/wordpress-shortcodes-complete-guide/) and other places like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) use them too.

WordPress' look like square brackets with content inside them.

```
[recent-posts]
```

but what if we need to configure them?

```
[recent-posts posts="5"]
```

or if we want to have some content that the shortcode uses to display. We'll call it "children".

```
[recent-posts posts="5"]Posts Heading[/recent-posts]
```

In all their variations across platforms, there's a bit of syntax marking the start of a shortcode, the attributes a shortcode might accept, and the children of the shortcode.

# Shortcodes and Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and if we look at the three previous examples we can see that React has solved this syntax in an open and ubiquitous way via [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

```js
<RecentPosts />
<RecentPosts posts={5} />
<RecentPosts posts={5}>Posts Heading</RecentPosts>
```

It would be great if we could not only re-use this syntax, but also re-use the entire React ecosystem as a set of shortcodes.

Well... we can.

## Gatsby and MDX

[MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) allows us to put React components inside Markdown content. As an example, if we wanted to render color picker (or a visualization of some data, etc) we could do the following:

```
import { SketchPicker } from 'react-color'

# Hello, world!

Here's a color picker!

<SketchPicker />
```

Which is great! We get our color picker rendered on the page in a very similar way to the shortcodes from WordPress or Hugo. There's still one problem though, the import. Shortcodes from other ecosystems don't need to be imported.

## Introducing globalScope

So in a [recent commit to gatsby-mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx/commit/df27bb47b936655a2422fd65b066e34d0b6c8720) I introduced a new configuration option called `globalScope`. This configuration option lets us specify a set of components that are then made available to any MDX content we render on our Gatsby site.

It works like this. In your gatsby config simple use a code string that imports some components and then exports an object of all of the components with the names you want to use for your shortcodes.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-mdx`,
      options: {
        globalScope: `import { SketchPicker } from 'react-color';
export default { Picker: SketchPicker }`,
      }
    },
  ]
};
```

and now this exact markdown content will render your shortcode, no import required.

```md
# A non-page

In not the pages directory, with nothing special about it

<Picker/>
```

You can check out the color picker example [on the gatsby-mdx kitchen sink site](https://gatsby-mdx-kitchen-sink.netlify.com/posts/non-page-global-scope).

## What next

Well, this can be applied to Youtube videos, Twitter oembeds, or anything else really. These components can even use any data in the page context, embed a `StaticQuery`, and they can execute completely arbitrary code because the shortcodes are now React components. The world is your oyster (it's not my oyster because I don't like oysters. That's why you get the oysters)
