Stack yields some nice benefits for blogging, tutorials, and more. The
main benefit I want to talk about today is reproducibility when using
stack to start a new project (in a tutorial).

## Resolvers

To ensure repeatable resolutions, choose a specific
[resolver][resolver]. Since even the nightlies get unique identifiers,
we can ensure that any future attempt at reproducing a given tutorial
is more likely to be successful.

## Templates

Stack can use templates from github. Pointing to a specific template,
whether custom or from the [stack-templates][templates] repo, is good
as well. Cloning git repos could be used as an alternative here, but
one advantage of using Stack's support is that you can now have a
single repo of templates and point to a specific git commit/file.

## Code

A fully qualified reproducible template commmand could look like:

```bash
stack new servant-users \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates/9a18e8762b8f048d403dabe5c19552ceb5292318/servant.hsfiles \
--resolver nightly-2016-04-10
```

-- note

Effectively, doing this is trying to freeze the (Hackage) world at a
specific point in time for a specific .cabal setup. I'd argue that
doing this is more useful (for tutorials) than trying to make sure a
tutorial compiles with any arbitrary future set of packages.
