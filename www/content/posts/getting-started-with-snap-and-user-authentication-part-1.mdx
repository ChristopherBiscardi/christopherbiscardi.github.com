[Part 2](http://www.christopherbiscardi.com/2014/01/10/getting-started-with-snap-and-user-authentication-part-2/)

Before we get started, there is a quickstart on the snap-framework site
[here](http://snapframework.com/docs/quickstart) that goes into the `barebones`
scaffold project a bit. This course will go a little more in depth into the
`default` project, exploring user authentication.

I use [hsenv](https://github.com/Paczesiowa/hsenv) to create separate Haskell
environments, but that is not a requirement and beginners may be more
comfortable installing the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)

If you wish to use hsenv, you can run this on newer versions:

```bash
hsenv --ghc=7.6.3
```

or download the package for ghc-7.6.3
[here](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_6_3) and run this:

```bash
hsenv --ghc=/path/to/downloaded/ghc-7.6.3-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
```

From here on out the process is the same if you’re using hsenv or not. Create a
new directory named “abc” and enter it. This will also function as the name of
our project and executable.

```bash
mkdir abc
cd abc
```

It’s good to update the package list when starting a new project:

```bash
cabal update
cabal install cabal-install
```

After updating and installing the new version of cabal-instal we can install
snap:

```bash
cabal install snap
```

At this point we will have the `snap` CLI and can run init to scaffold a default
project. After scaffolding, we then run `cabal install` to compile the binary
and `abc` to run the project. `abc` will also take a port as such: `abc -p 8000`

```bash
snap init
cabal install
abc -p 8000
```

Our app, abc, should now be running. Navigate to `localhost:8000` (or the port
you specified) in your browser to take a look.

In the next post we’ll take a look at the code we generated and take a brief
overview of what it does.
