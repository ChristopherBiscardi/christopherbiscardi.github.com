Sometimes as a Gatsby theme author you need to take a theme option and inject it into the bundle in an arbitrary location. Using web pack's `DefinePlugin` lets us do this using special tokens.

Let's say we want to add some feature flags to our application to control whether the application is built with a sidebar or not. We can accept the option in the theme and use it to set up a feature flag called `__FLAG_SIDEBAR_ENABLED__`.

```js title=gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = (
  { stage, rules, loaders, plugins, actions },
  options
) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    plugins: [
      plugins.define({
        __FLAG_SIDEBAR_ENABLED__: options.enableSidebar
      })
    ]
  });
};
```

Wherever we use this flag, webpack will replace the value with a boolean literal, so we can use this to enable or disable features of our application.

```js title=src/components/layout.js
import React from "react";

export default props => (
  <div>
    {__FLAG_SIDEBAR_ENABLED__ && <aside>some sidebar content</aside>}
    <main>{props.children}</main>
  </div>
);
```

Note that when using this pattern, it can also be useful to consider using a [custom configuration node](/post/applying-theme-options-using-custom-configuration-nodes/) instead, as that will let you `useStaticQuery` to access specific information.
