First Retrieve the Rebar Templates and put them in ~/.rebar/templates

```shell
git clone git://github.com/rzezeski/rebar_riak_core.git
mkdir ~/.rebar /templates

cp rebar_riak_core/* ~/.rebar /templates
```

You’ll also need [Rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar) and [Erlang](). I used
[homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to get them:

[bash] brew install erlang rebar [/bash]

Now that you’re set up, you can create a new multinode app from the templates.
Replace myapp with whatever you want to call your new app in the following
command:

```
cd ~/where/I/want/my/app
```

rebar create template=riak_core_multinode appid=myapp nodeid=myapp

You can now `make` and run the code.

```
 make rel
 ./rel/myapp/bin/myapp console
```

If all goes well you should be sitting in a console for your app. Run [erlang]
myapp:ping(). [/erlang] to ping a random vnode.
