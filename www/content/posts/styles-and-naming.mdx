> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
>
> \-- Phil Karlton

Phil Karlton (and many people after) said that one of the hardest problems
in computer science is naming things. This is unfortunate for us because it means that
building a design system is a hard problem before we even get to any
of the underlying design and technology issues. This is because design
systems define the language we use to communicate across boundaries
(organizational or otherwise).

Design tools make it easy to refer to specific pieces of our visual
user interfaces because they are typically manual-labor driven. Each
layer, symbol, or object is given a handcrafted name. We can name what
we want and leave parts that don't need names, nameless. "Untitled
Path 4" is arguably a great name for something that doesn't come up in
conversation often while "Button" is a great name for the conventional
`Button` component being shipped as part of a symbol library.

Using component driven models for the technical implementations of our
components allows us to take a similar approach. On the web we can use
the primitives given to us by the platform (`div`, `span`, `section`, etc)
when we have no use for a system-level name
and we can give names to more complex components, such as "Tooltip",
"Pagination", or "DangerZone". This ability to name (and importantly,
not name) components is built into component driven libraries such as
React.

```js
export default class Tooltip extends React.Component { ... }
export const Pagination = props => (...)
```

Especially when it comes to CSS, we run into problems
quickly because classnames are the base primitive of CSS APIs. This means
that that historically CSS has forced us to over-index on creating
names for everything, even those objects that we shouldn't name. We've
tried to solve these problems through manual approaches like \[Block
Element Modifier (BEM)], mirroring the hand-crafted approach our
design tools use. The problem with approaches like BEM is that we have
no way to leave objects unnamed. BEM, and approaches like it,
represent a local maximum for how we use CSS. Until we get away from
the requirement to name everything we will be stuck with the problems
naming everything leaves us with. Consider the following real-world
example from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), a popular library that offers a
CSS API.

```html
<nav aria-label="Pagination Example">
  <ul class="pagination pagination-lg">
    <li class="page-item disabled">
      <a class="page-link" href="#" aria-label="previous">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
        <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">1</a></li>
    <li class="page-item active">
      <a class="page-link" href="#">2 <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
    </li>
    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">3</a></li>
    <li class="page-item">
      <a class="page-link" href="#" aria-label="next">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&raquo;</span>
        <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

As it turns out, CSS is too low level to accurately reflect the
language we use to talk about the components of our system. When given
a pure CSS API we have to compose the various pieces together
ourselves. There is no way to check (besides reading the
documentation) that the way we've used the classes and written the
markup is supported. There's also confusion caused by the fact that we
name every element. Do we really need a name for `page-link`? We
already reference the object using `page-item` and we know it's a link
because we're using an anchor tag. We're also manually specifying
accessibility concerns which opens up the potential to break
accessibility accidentally if you don't know when to use aria
labels. What does it mean for a page item to be disabled? Can the
entire pagination component be disabled? How do we evolve our CSS API
if we can't make guarantees about how consumers are using it?

## A higher level of abstraction

At this point we've touched on a few of the naming issues relating to
how we build and implement our language's styles. Now we'll look to
what different abstractions can bring us to solve some of
them. Remember that we're using specific technologies to talk about
general problems so the same approach to abstracting can be useful
whether your platform's styling primitives are CSS or something else.

A CSS style sheet (yes, you read that correctly. A Cascading Style
Sheets style sheet) is an abstract concept that represents a style
sheet as defined by the CSS specification. The CSS Object Model
([CSSOM](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/)) defines a set of parsing and serialization rules for
Media Queries, Selectors, and CSS itself (CSS itself is a spec
composed of multiple specs). Using these built-in platform APIs we can
build a higher level abstraction that allows us to solve the naming
issues we've discussed previously.

## When to name components

Components can be though of in levels of sophistication. As you ascend
higher in the chain, the component is more re-usable but also takes
more effort to maintain. The list, from lowest to highest is:

1. divs, one-off styles, inline overrides, etc
2. (private) sub-components
3. (public) sub-components (components that get too complex for a
   single file, thus are nested under in a directory. routes.)
4. A project's components/ folder ("Named objects local to this project")
5. Design system component library
   * Can have it's own stages of acceptance, support, and usage suggestions.
   * is accompanied by additional requirements (documentation, design
   artifacts, tests, etc)

## Introducing Emotion

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) is a library that introduces a new set of
APIs for the creation, composition, and naming of styles on top of the
platform's CSS APIs. We'll explore the usage of these APIs from a
component oriented perspective from the least nameable objects to the
most depended on components of our language. Although we'll be talking
about emotion in the context of React, the library can be used without
React and integrating with other component abstractions as well.

### The div who shall not be named

Every product has a need for soup. Soup is a shorthand for the one off
styles, that extra div you need to work around a platform issue, or
glue that binds two slightly-incompatible abstractions together. Soup,
perhaps more than any other level, needs to be written in a way that
is easy to delete because there are two basic evolutionary paths for
soup.

1. To be extended indefinitely
2. To be continuously deleted and rewritten many times as requirements evolve

The option we want to enable people to choose is option 2. Option 1 is
the state of much CSS (and other code) in the world. The styles
written for soup are often bad offenders of being hard to understand
messes of code and because soup is often the glue between
abstractions, bad abstractions cause compoundingly worse soup. Some of
the reasons people extend indefinitely are

* The code behaves non-deterministically so making the smallest
  possible change is desired so as to not upset the balance
* Copy/pasted code has been removed from it's original context and the
  product is complicated enough to work with that not all code paths
  can be tested (so we don't want to delete the code in question so as
  to not accidentally break something)
* It's hard to delete code that isn't co-located. Often CSS is written
  in separate files, processed by a compiler, and mangled to the point
  where it can be hard to locate which CSS in which files and what
  combinations can affect the rendering behavior of the part of the
  page you're interested in.

All of these reasons have something in common: They have large
components of fear driving behavior (often the fear of breaking
production). To be successful at taking Option 2, we need to remove
the fear that deleting a line of code might break something completely
unrelated.

Deleting and rewriting code also allows you to come at it with fresh
perspective for potential new abstractions, so we want to be able to
easily take the soup and bring it up into the next level on the
component hierarchy as a sub-component.

### The CSS prop

Emotion provides an API for creating soup that co-locates the styles
with the rendering path and allows access to theming (more on theming
later). This API is called the CSS prop and we can use it in
combination with another core feature, the css tagged template
literal. Let's start with a small example: Overriding the color of a
paragraph to give it more emphasis on the page. We really like pink,
so we'll use `hotpink` to highlight this section of text.

```js
const MyContent = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Some blog post where I am writing about things!</p>
    <p
      css={css`
        color: hotpink;
      `}
    >
      Making this paragraph stand out with color
    </p>
    <p>Some more content after the callout</p>
  </div>
);
```

Notice how we've co-located one-off styles in a way that allows us to
easily delete the styles _with_ the paragraph that uses them. It's
very clear that none of the other paragraphs use this styling, so we
don't need to worry about tracking down other usage of it. Using the
CSS Prop API, we don't need to give a name to this one paragraph that
happens to have a different color but is otherwise exactly the same as
every other paragraph.

Looking at a larger example, we can take the pagination code from
earlier and use the CSS Prop to remove names from objects that don't
need them. Our first abstraction is going to be at the `page-item`
level, so we'll create a `PageItem` component for our markup to live
in.

```js
cont PageItem = ({ children }) => (
    <li className="page-item">
      <a className="page-link" href="#">{children}</a>
    </li>
)
```

Converting this to use the CSS Prop allows us to remove the global
nature of `page-link`. It no longer references a classname that could
exist anywhere in our codebase and thus we've removed the ability for
unexpected results when we render this component.

note: `&` is the "self" selector, so `&:hover` is saying "when this
component is hovered".

```js
import { css } from "@emotion/core";

const PageItem = ({ children }) => (
  <li className="page-item">
    <a
      css={css`
        position: relative;
        display: block;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 2;
        }
      `}
      href="#"
    >
      {children}
    </a>
  </li>
);
```

## Unnamed by default

The default options are perhaps one of the strongest levers we
have when building new products, tools, and even interacting with
people day to day. Most people end up taking the default path with few
opting out. Knowing that we have an incredible amount of power to
determine what the majority of people will do means that we have a
responsibility to make the best option, the easy option.

When applying that to CSS, that means we need to change the default
from naming everything to making naming opt-in. _By default_, objects
in our system should be unnamed. When the abstractions we use rise to
the level of reusable components we should have an easy path from soup
to a more structured approach with named objects. Emotion's `css`
tagged template literal is unnamed by default, you can not get a
classname from it without additional effort (admittedly the effort is
small, but once again defaults are overwhelmingly followed). Being
unnamed by default means we can use the `css` prop and tagged template
literal to elevate to named object only that which has been reused
multiple times.

## Working with sub-components

Now that we've seen how to create soup let's take a look at how we can
move one level up the chain and start creating
sub-components. Sub-components are named components that compose
together to create a larger component or system of components.

Let's say we wanted to lay out application out in a classic
sidebar/content area structure like this:

```
--------------------
| s |              |
| i |              |
| d |              |
| e |   content    |
| b |              |
| a |              |
| r |              |
--------------------
```

We could set up our app's layout in a component using the css prop as such:

```js
import { css } from "@emotion/core";

const AppLayout = ({ sidebar, children }) => (
  <div
    css={css`
      max-width: 960px;
      margin: auto;
      display: flex;
    `}
  >
    <aside
      css={css`
        flex: 1;
      `}
    >
      {sidebar}
    </aside>
    <section
      css={css`
        flex: 3;
      `}
    >
      {children}
    </section>
  </div>
);
```

This can be fine in the case that we have a single app and a single
layout (for example, we could use this component to build a Gatsby
page layout using `wrapPageElement` APIs). In this case, it can still
be beneficial to name the components in our layout for clarity. We
could call them `SidebarArea` and `ContentArea` to denote that we've
allocated this space to the sidebar navigation and the content
respectively.

```js
import { css } from "@emotion/core";

const SidebarArea = ({ children, ...props }) => (
  <aside
    css={css`
      flex: 1;
    `}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </aside>
);

const ContentArea = ({ children, ...props }) => (
  <section
    css={css`
      flex: 3;
    `}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </section>
);

const AppLayout = ({ sidebar, children }) => (
  <div
    css={css`
      max-width: 960px;
      margin: auto;
      display: flex;
    `}
  >
    <SidebarArea>{sidebar}</SidebarArea>
    <ContentArea>{children}</ContentArea>
  </div>
);
```

This approach documents that we have some infrastructure
dedicated to providing an area for each section of the page. It also
allows us to not name the containing `div`, which would likely have an
equally generic name such as `Container` right now. Renaming `div` as
`Container` may or may not yield benefits depending on how we evolve
over time. We could, for example, have a `MarketingSiteContainer` and
an `ApplicationContainer` in the future and in the interest of
avoiding premature abstraction, we've chosen to not name it yet.

### Pagination

In our pagination example, let's say we wanted to mirror Bootstrap's
API specifically because we weren't just building a pagination
component, but we were trying to build a "bootstrap in React" library
that stayed as true to the original as possible. We could create two
components to mirror the `page-item` and `page-link` nomenclature.

```js
import { css } from "@emotion/core";

const PageItem = ({ children, ...props }) => (
  <li
    css={css`
      &:first-child {
        ...;
      }
    `}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </li>
);

const PageLink = ({ children, ...props }) => (
  <a
    css={css`
      position: relative;
      display: block;

      &:hover {
        z-index: 2;
      }
    `}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </a>
);
```

We would then use these in place of the original elements

```js
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

render(
  <nav aria-label="Pagination Example">
    <ul className="pagination pagination-lg">
      <PageItem disabled>
        <PageLink href="#" aria-label="previous">
          <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
          <span className="sr-only">Previous</span>
        </PageLink>
      </PageItem>
      <PageItem>
        <PageLink href="#">1</PageLink>
      </PageItem>
      <PageItem active>
        <PageLink href="#">
          2 <span className="sr-only">(current)</span>
        </PageLink>
      </PageItem>
      <PageItem>
        <PageLink href="#">3</PageLink>
      </PageItem>
      <PageItem>
        <PageLink href="#" aria-label="next">
          <span aria-hidden="true">&raquo;</span>
          <span className="sr-only">Next</span>
        </PageLink>
      </PageItem>
    </ul>
  </nav>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Something interesting we've done here is that we have a few props
being passed in to our `PageItem` component (specifically `active` and
`disabled`). If we go back to our component definition, we can use
these props to change the way we style the component. In this example
we're choosing to show a different style of cursor based on whether
the pagination item is disabled or not.

```js
const PageItem = ({ children, disabled, ...props }) => (
  <li
    css={css`
      cursor: ${disabled ? "auto" : "pointer"};
      &:first-child {
        ...;
      }
    `}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </li>
);
```

We are now progressively evolving our system into one that we can talk
about at a high level. We'll talk more about creating component APIs
and composing styles later. For now just know that it's possible to
access props and change how a component styles itself based on those
props.

## Public and Private Sub-components

The biggest difference between public and private sub-components is
where they're located relative to the components that use them. A
private sub-component is a styled-component in the same file as the
component that uses it. This sub-component is not exported, but is
named and abstracted out of the core component. This is useful to do
when components start to get more complicated but aren't ready to be
fully abstracted into their own files.

For our pagination example, it's likely that `PageItem`, `PageLink`
and `Pagination` are all going to be used by the consumer, so we'd
want them to be public. Imagine a directory structure that has the
component name as the folder name, with each sub-component broken out
into its own file.

```shell
➜ tree pagination
pagination
├── index.js
├── page-item.js
└── page-link.js

0 directories, 3 files
```

We can use this structure to indicate that `Pagination` uses
`page-item` and `page-link` as sub-components in the rendering
tree. We've structured our filesystem in the same way the React
DevTools will show them in the DOM, making them easier to find.

The `index.js` file could look like this.

```js
export { default as PageItem } from "./page-item";
export { default as PageLink } from "./page-link";

export default styled.ul`
  display: flex;
`;
```

and be used in the same way as before:

```js
import Pagination, { PageItem, PageLink } from "./pagination";

const MyThing = () => (
  <Pagination size="large">
    <PageItem disabled>
      <PageLink href="#" aria-label="previous">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
        <span className="sr-only">Previous</span>
      </PageLink>
    </PageItem>
  </Pagination>
);
```

## A Project's Component's Folder

Our `Pagination` components have been in the codebase a bit now and
are starting to see some usage outside of the original file we built
them for. It's time to pull it out into our local components folder. A
local components folder is like a staging ground for the design
system. Many components won't make it to this level, and even less
will make it out of the components folder into the design system.

Our sub-components are likely officially public at this point and we
have to start thinking about how people are going to use the
components together. If we've followed Option 2, (deleting and
rewriting code), it's likely that we can simply move the pagination
folder to our components folder, rename some imports and call it a
day. We may also want to take this opportunity to rethink some of the
easier API changes if we're noticed friction as the component gets
wider use outside of the original context.

## Bringing it all together: A Design System Component

Now our `Pagination` component doesn't just have wide usage in our
application, but other products and sites need pagination as well. We
have to move it out of our project into a more globally accessible
place.

Assuming that we already have a multi-package repo set up so that we
have a place to put our design system components we now start thinking
harder about the way this component will impact the language (and
thus, every product it touches). It's time to do a rethink of the core
`Pagination` API.

### Thinking in components

When building components to be reusable we can take roughly two
approaches

1. Extensible
2. Locked Down

Extensible components often come in groups that can be replaced
without additional core API changes. An `Icon` component, for example,
can be written to take an svg as an argument, allowing a very light
weight process for adding an icon that may be only useful in a single
location.

```js
import { House } from "../house.svg";
import Icon from "our-icon";

<Icon svg={House} />;
```

Alternatively, we could lock down the `Icon` API by making it possible
to only specify the name of a pre-allocated set of icons. This
provides a conceptually simpler API and also means that the users of
this component have to engage in a heavier weight process to introduce
new icons.

```js
import Icon from "our-icon";

<Icon name="house" />;
```

The tradeoffs in these approaches are in how many people you need to
maintain the core libraries and in the failure modes you choose
(When the user of my component finds themselves in a situation the
component doesn't work for, do they _override_ the component or do
they _fork_ the component).

#### Pagination Components

With some API focus in mind let's take a look at the output of our
pagination. It has looked something like this from the beginning:

```html
<nav aria-label="Pagination Example">
  <ul class="pagination pagination-lg">
    <li class="page-item disabled">
      <a class="page-link" href="#" aria-label="previous">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
        <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">1</a></li>
    <li class="page-item active">
      <a class="page-link" href="#">2 <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
    </li>
    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">3</a></li>
    <li class="page-item">
      <a class="page-link" href="#" aria-label="next">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&raquo;</span>
        <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

One of the first abstractions we can start to notice are blocks of
elements behaving as a single unit, such as the `<li>` always wrapping
an `<a>` tag while the `<a>` tag can have a variety of content. The
`<li>` and the `<a>` are acting as a single unit in this case, so
let's call that unit `Item`.

The `<nav>` and `<ul>` tags are also used as a single unit. Our
pagination is _always_ going to be considered a naviation element, so
we can bundle them together too. We'll use `Pagination` for this.

Finally, we have the option of encapsulating the previous and next
buttons as logic in our pagination component itself, which leads us to
another interesting question. Do we need to expose the `Item` component
at all?

#### Pagination

We'll start with the `Pagination` component. It's two elements
combined so we'll avoid using a styled component here and because
neither of the sub-elements need to be named (because we're naming the
block), we'll use the css Prop.

```js
export default ({ label, ...props }) => (
  <nav aria-label={label}>
    <ul
      css={css`
        display: flex;
        list-style-type: none;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      `}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </ul>
  </nav>
);
```

Notice that since we still have the open question of whether we need
the `Item` component exposed to the user or not, we use `children` to
pass through anything the user decides they need.

##### Size

The other variation we need to account for is the `size`. When looking
at the bootstrap code for different sizes, there's a mixin used to
define larger and smaller sizes, while the default size is left
implicit.

```scss
.pagination-lg {
  @include pagination-size(
    $pagination-padding-y-lg,
    $pagination-padding-x-lg,
    $font-size-lg,
    $line-height-lg,
    $border-radius-lg
  );
}

.pagination-sm {
  @include pagination-size(
    $pagination-padding-y-sm,
    $pagination-padding-x-sm,
    $font-size-sm,
    $line-height-sm,
    $border-radius-sm
  );
}
```

The mixin is defined as a collection of other mixins and some variables.

```scss
@mixin pagination-size(
  $padding-y,
  $padding-x,
  $font-size,
  $line-height,
  $border-radius
) {
  .page-link {
    padding: $padding-y $padding-x;
    font-size: $font-size;
    line-height: $line-height;
  }

  .page-item {
    &:first-child {
      .page-link {
        @include border-left-radius($border-radius);
      }
    }
    &:last-child {
      .page-link {
        @include border-right-radius($border-radius);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It is interesting to note that the mixin applies no styles to the
`Pagination` elements, but rather overrides the sub-elements
`page-link` and `page-item`. To make use of these styles, we'll
co-locate them with their respective components. This has the
additional benefit that the individual sub-components contain all the
logic needed to render themselves in every variation they need to be
rendered in, which makes it easier to test, modify, and use.

We still need to allow users to specify the size on the `Pagination`
component though, since it's a global API that applies to all
direct sub-components. We can modify the `children` prop we're using
to inject our `size` prop by mapping over the `children` and cloning
the elements. (note: We use `React.Children.map` because it has some
special handling for React children types).

```js
export default ({ label, size, ...props }) => (
  <nav aria-label={label}>
    <ul
      css={css`
        display: flex;
        list-style-type: none;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      `}
      {...props}
    >
      {React.Children.map(children, child =>
        React.cloneElement(child, { size, ...child.props })
      )}
    </ul>
  </nav>
);
```

The positioning of `size` that we've chosen is interesting because it
establishes an order of precedence for how the `size` prop will apply.
In this case, it means that children can override the `Pagination`
component's `size` prop. This is another example of choosing
extensibility vs locking down APIs. Passing the prop down to children
also allows us to define an explicit contract that others (or
ourselves, if we don't expose the individual pieces) could implement
to extend the API and create different types of pagination
sub-components.

#### Item

`Item` is our next component. It's also a combination of two elements
so we'll take the same approach and use the CSS Prop.

If we look at the CSS for `page-item`, we see that it's really only
applying styles conditionally to the `page-link`. Since we aren't
relying on a pure CSS API anymore, we don't need to use approaches
that reach into other objects as often and can move the styles into
the anchor itself. This co-location of the variants of a particular
element means that we have fewer places to look when trying to figure
out why a particular element is rendering a particular way. This means
we can work faster, with more confidence, and most importantly delete
without fear.

```scss
.page-item {
  &:first-child {
    .page-link {
      margin-left: 0;
      @include border-left-radius($border-radius);
    }
  }
  &:last-child {
    .page-link {
      @include border-right-radius($border-radius);
    }
  }

  &.active .page-link {
    z-index: 1;
    color: $pagination-active-color;
    background-color: $pagination-active-bg;
    border-color: $pagination-active-border-color;
  }

  &.disabled .page-link {
    color: $pagination-disabled-color;
    pointer-events: none;
    // Opinionated: remove the "hand" cursor set previously for .page-link
    cursor: auto;
    background-color: $pagination-disabled-bg;
    border-color: $pagination-disabled-border-color;
  }
}
```

From the html output we've been looking at and the SASS code, we can
consolidate the list of variations we're going to need to support.

* First item
* Last item
* Disabled
* Active
* hover
* focus

Notably:

* `disabled` and `active` can not happen at the same time. `disabled`
  always wins if both are applied.
* `hover` applies differently based on whether `active` or `disabled`
  are applied.
* focus is independent of anything
* There are styles that apply only to the first or last `Item`

The bootstrap classnames API is well coded in that is makes
overlapping states apply consistently (`.disabled` always takes
precedence over `.active` regardless of the classname application
order). We can do better in our component API because we have richer
data structures to work with, so let's focus on making illegal states
_unrepresentable_.

We can represent the possible options for props with a pseudocode object like
this:

```js
type Props = {
  is: IsVariants,
  position: PosVariants
};

type IsVariants = DISABLED | ACTIVE;

type PosVariants = FIRST | MIDDLE | LAST;
```

`focus` and `hover` states _could_ be included in the prop API for
documentation reasons (to force the rendering of the `Item` component
in a specific state), but we'll leave them to just CSS for now.

A basic abstraction could look like this:

```js
const Item = ({ children, is, position, href = "#" }) => (
  <li>
    <a href={href}>{children}</a>
  </li>
);
```

##### Theming

The SASS code from Bootstrap uses a bunch of variables to define the
visual aspects of the pagination component and some interaction
behaviors (hover, focus, etc).

```scss
.page-link {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  padding: $pagination-padding-y $pagination-padding-x;
  margin-left: -$pagination-border-width;
  line-height: $pagination-line-height;
  color: $pagination-color;
  background-color: $pagination-bg;
  border: $pagination-border-width solid $pagination-border-color;

  &:hover {
    z-index: 2;
    color: $pagination-hover-color;
    text-decoration: none;
    background-color: $pagination-hover-bg;
    border-color: $pagination-hover-border-color;
  }

  &:focus {
    z-index: 2;
    outline: $pagination-focus-outline;
    box-shadow: $pagination-focus-box-shadow;
  }

  // Opinionated: add "hand" cursor to non-disabled .page-link elements
  &:not(:disabled):not(.disabled) {
    cursor: pointer;
  }
}
```

To avoid losing this ability to define different sizes and colors,
we'll take a simple pass as using theming to preserve the variables.

```js
const Item = ({ children, is, position, href = "#" }) => (
  <li>
    <a
      href={href}
      css={({ pagination }) => css`
        position: relative;
        display: block;
        padding: ${pagination.paddingY} ${pagination.paddingX};
        margin-left: ${-pagination.borderWidth};
        line-height: ${pagination.lineHeight};
        color: ${pagination.color};
        background-color: ${pagination.bg};
        border: ${pagination.borderWidth} solid ${pagination.borderColor};

        &:hover {
          z-index: 2;
          color: ${pagination.hoverColor};
          text-decoration: none;
          background-color: ${pagination.hoverBg};
          border-color: ${pagination.hoverBorderColor};
        }

        &:focus {
          z-index: 2;
          outline: ${pagination.focusOutline};
          box-shadow: ${pagination.focusBoxShadow};
        }

        // Opinionated: add "hand" cursor to non-disabled .page-link elements
        &:not(:disabled):not(.disabled) {
          cursor: pointer;
        }
      `}
    >
      {children}
    </a>
  </li>
);
```

The full list of theming variables from all of the SASS looks
something like this. note: these have been calculated by following the
trail of SASS variables through multiple layers. If we were building
an entire library based on Bootstrap we could include those extra
variables here as well.

```js
const theme = {
  pagination: {
    activeBg: "#007bff",
    activeBorderColor: "#007bff",
    activeColor: "#fff",
    bg: "#fff",
    borderColor: "#dee2e6",
    borderRadius: ".25rem",
    borderRadiusLg: ".3rem",
    borderRadiusSm: ".2rem",
    borderWidth: TODO,
    color: "#007bff ",
    disabledBg: "#fff",
    disabledBorderColor: "#dee2e6",
    disabledColor: "#6c757d",
    focusBoxShadow: "0 0 0 0.2rem ",
    focusOutline: 0,
    fontSize: "1rem",
    fontSizeLg: "1.25rem",
    fontSizeSm: "0.875rem",
    hoverBg: "#e9ecef",
    hoverBorderColor: "#dee2e6",
    hoverColor: "rgba(0,123,255, 0.25)",
    lineHeight: "1.25",
    lineHeightLg: "1.5",
    lineHeightSm: "1.5",
    paddingX: ".75rem",
    paddingXLg: "1.5rem",
    paddingXSm: ".5rem",
    paddingY: "5rem",
    paddingYLg: ".75rem",
    paddingYSm: ".25rem"
  }
};
```

# Not Really the End

From here on out we can take our `Pagination` components and continue to generalize them until we get to a tested, documented, re-usable component. We can use abstractions that return different styles for sizes, position in a list, and more:

```js
const positionStyles = ({ position }) => {
  switch (position) {
    case "first":
      return css``;
    case "last":
      return css``;
    default:
      return css``;
  }
};

const isStyles = ({ is }) => {
  switch (is) {
    case "disabled":
      return css``;
    case "active":
      return css``;
    default:
      return css``;
  }
};
```

The point of this post is to rethink the defaults that we use to construct UI. We should not name everything by default, choosing only to give names when there is meaning to communicate. I also want to introduce you to the idea that the `css` prop allows us to execute on all of the levels of our design system components, from scratchy one-offs up to fully re-usable components that are part of a public library. We can even give names to styles that matter with the css template literal or by using composable objects.
