traefik DNS provider: `gcloud` can automate the DNS
verification.

- `GCE_PROJECT`
- `GCE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE`

wildcard has to be main domain; each domain and SAN results
in a cert request.

```
[acme]
   [[acme.domains]]
      main = "*.local3.com"
      sans = ["local3.com", "test1.test1.local3.com"]
   [acme.dnsChallenge]
      provider = "gcloud"
      delayBeforeCheck = 0
   caServer = "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
```
