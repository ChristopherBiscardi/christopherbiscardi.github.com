title: DynamoDB
---

- Single table design is heavily suggested

  - you can theoretically fit all of your SQL tables into it
  - pk and sk names for primary keys
    - then gsi (global secondary index) other access
      patterns
    - known as "overloaded indexes" because you can stick
      arbitrary values in for different data types

- Primary Key _has_ to be an EQ statement
- secondary key can have conditionals like >=, starts_with,
  etc

- low level API vs Document API vs High Level API

  - high level is only java/.net
  - document is available for more, like node
  - low level is low

- dynamo streams for getting data out
- maybe kinesis + _something_ with automerge + lambda for
  CRDT fronted dynamo tables?

- You can "batch get", nice for graphql optimizations
- response times measured in milliseconds, but DAX caching
  (dynamodb accelerator) can accelerate to microseconds.
