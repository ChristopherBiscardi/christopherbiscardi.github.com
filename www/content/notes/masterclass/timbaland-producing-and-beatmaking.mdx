title: Timbaland Masterclass

## Introduction

Everyone is welcome in producing as long as you love music

---

Uses Beatbox to get basic melody out fast. Rough, fast tool.

Cry Me a River was started as a Beatbox

Multi track recording. record 2 bars, loop, record more on
top, loop, etc. In order did:

- melody, hums, breath work came first
- cymbals, etc
- light snares, claps, bass
- Atmospherics. High reverb, etc.
- heavy drum kit added in
- nonsense words/pseudo lyrics, describing the main solo

Early stuff is basic. Later stuff is more complex. Stacks.

- If you don't know beatbox, you can hum. "It's not stupid".
- You can edit anything, be free.

## Studio Session: Making a BeatBox Beat

- Multiple people, multiple computers, looks like Ableton.
- Playing around with samples on a pad. Tapping some out
  whenever it feels right for a particular part
- just adding, filling space.

Take a step back and come back to it later. Don't rush. As
long as you're living, you got all the time in the world.

## Building Beats: Tim's Process

Naming and creativity. Disorganization as a way to inject
creativity and re-discovery of samples.

- timbo drum rack 01
- timbo drum rack 02
- timbo drum rack 03

"Drum rack with the big bass" is a draw. Every time you'll
go back. numbering creates more diversity through removing
selection bias.

Core take away on the series so far seems to be "play enough
and you'll eventually get there". Timbaland has had decades
worth of playing with this stuff so has built up an
intuition about his samples, how everything works, etc and
relies on that intuition to make changes.
