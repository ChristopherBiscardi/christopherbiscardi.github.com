- `Commands` are user intent: `insertBreak`, `insertText`,
  etc
- `Operations` are low-level primitives, and how Slate
  support collaborative editing. These are the "events" that
  happen to the document.

* You can override `Commands`

```js
const { insertText } = editor;
editor.insertText = text => {
  if (text === "&") {
    // always replace `&` with the word `and`
    insertText("and");
  } else {
    // otherwise let the usual happen
    insertText(text);
  }
};
```

- Ways of annotating points
  - short
    ```
    Location = Path | Point | Range
    Path = number[]
    Point = {
        path: Path
        offset: number
        [key: string]: any
    }
    Range {
        anchor: Point
        focus: Point
        [key: string]: any
    }
    Span = [Path, Path]
    ```
  - Path is an array of indexes through a tree
  - Point is the location of a single Text node.
    - _points can only refer to Text nodes_
  - Ranges can span across nodes

* testing
  - don't render, just create editors and use `Commands`
    since `Commands` signify a user _intent_
