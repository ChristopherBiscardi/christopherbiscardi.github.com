# Exercise 1

## Supervised Learning

- facial detection (recognizing faces)
- detecting materials on other planets
- UFO detection

## Unsupervised Learning

- facial detection (grouping into specific people)
- trading anomaly detection (to stop trading for day)

## Reinforcement Learning

- driving/staying in a lane
- game character learning to walk

# Exercise 1 bottom half

- Your ex just arrived: house go dark and lock up
  - face detection and identification
- anomaly detection: you just subscribed to 50 streamers,
  maybe calm down
- save money on insurance by using self-driving car

- If we’re looking at how to improve our menu photos so they
  are more crisp, we’d use what?
  - Super Resolution

* If we’re looking to identify what food item was in a menu
  photo, we’d use what?
  - image classification

- If we’re looking to identify where all the food photos on
  a menu were, we’d use what?

  - object recognition

- If we wanted to highlight all our vegan friendly items
  with yellow on a menu, we’d use what?

  - image classification

- If we wanted to remove backgrounds from our food photos,
  we’d use what?
  - masking

* If we wanted to remove food, and just have background
  images without a large empty space, we’d use what?
  - inpainting
