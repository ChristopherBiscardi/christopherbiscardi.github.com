# Safari exercise 1

---

- uneasy, but seems to have a process that works to an
  extent
- wants to be told how to do it
- person A just rambles
- DTLow has a set of templates and a custom script
  - including data validation
  - syncs with a calender
  - clips and saves as attachment for webpages, etc
- structured titles because they aren't comfortable using
  search?
- sorted by date
- tags
- "it's just how you are man" -- fixed mindset. skip this
  person.
- how do we help people _become_ organized people rather
  than feeling like they're just messy forever.
- possible that any templates/tips/etc won't help because OP
  already uses the tools and just doesn't feel good about
  it.
- OP was talking about internal to doc style.
- seems insecure more than incapable posts a decent amount
