title: Takin notes on FaunaDB
---

- Multi-tenant
  - Nested Databases
  - How do cross-database permissions work?
  - "Team per database" model? from a saas perspective
  - Can you dev against a single DB and just "expand" to
    multi? Only difference is keys.
  - Indexes
    - how.tf do you create indexes across hundreds of
      database's collections operationally
- Temporal querying
  - Is using this as application history useful?
  - When to trim?
    - Is "all history" important?
    - Can it be done per-nested-database if so?
    - plans upgrade settings?
    - History can be changed "after the fact" and is a
      Collection setting, not DB
