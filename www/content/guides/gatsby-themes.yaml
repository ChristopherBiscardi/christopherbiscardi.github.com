title: Gatsby Themes
slug: gatsby-themes
description: Gatsby Themes are an abstraction I built into Gatsby core. They allow you to ship bundles of functionality to NPM to share with other sites. They are conceptually similar to WordPress themes and far more powerful. The Shadowing API and Gatsby lifecycles can be used to modify the behavior or rendering of a theme.
