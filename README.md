# Chris Biscardi's Blog

My blog is a Gatsby site that uses a personal design system called
[Sens8](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/sens8).

# Running the Site

Since I added
[Webmentions](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/building-gatsby-plugin-webmentions)
you probably can't run this site on your own unless you want to use your own API
token.

```
yarn
WEBMENTION_TOKEN=a-token yarn develop
```
